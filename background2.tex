\chapter{Hierarchical Clustering Background}
\label{cha:background2}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In this section we review the relevant terminology and background that is
required for the remainder of this thesis.  We begin with general the general
theory of graphs, trees and their relationship to distances and special types
of metrics.  We then look at the problem of constructing trees from distances
and finally at the theory of ``lassoing'' a tree with incomplete distance
information.

\section{Graphs, Trees and Distances}
\label{sec:graphs-trees-dist}

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:history}

Trees have been used to represent hierarchical structures for many hundreds of
years.  One of the most well-known and ubiquitous occurrences is that of the
family tree.  The use of a tree to represent lineages was widespread in Europe
by the 14th Century in Christian artwork depicted the ancestors of Jesus of
Nazareth.  This tree is known as the Tree of Jesse \cite{corblet1860etude}.

Darwin would later popularise the concept of the more general ``tree of life''
in his seminal work \textit{On the Origin of Species}
\cite{darwin1859origin}.

Darwin's first tree (Figure~\ref{fig:darwin-tree}) shows the theoretical
relationship between an ancestral species (1) and its descendant species.
Extant species are shown by tips on the endpoints of some branches with the
remaining branches representing extinct species.  His idea was that groups of
species would have diverged at different times and therefore some groups will
be more closely related than others.  For example, the species labelled by B
and C would be more closely related than those labelled by A and D.

    notebook \textit{Transmutation of species}, 1837 \cite{darwin1837notebook}.}
  \label{fig:darwin-tree}
\end{figure}

Trees as a formally defined mathematical entity, such as the ones will see in
the following sections, appeared as early as 1847 with the name ``tree''
appearing in the literature shortly afterwards \cite{knuth97taocp1}.  The more
general theory of graphs and topology was developed earlier and is considered
to have begun with Euler who in 1735 presented the paper ``Solutio problematis
ad geometriam situs pertinentis'' \cite{euler1735solutio} in which it was
shown that it was not possible to walk through the city of Königsburg crossing
each of its seven bridges exactly once.

Tree structures have been of great importance in computer programming.  They
were first used explicitly to represent algebraic formulae for the purpose of
symbolic differentiation \citep{kahrimanian53differentiation}.  This would
later become the field of computer algebra which would drive the development
of computer science and especially programming languages for many years.

It makes sense to arrange many different types of information in trees,
particularly those for which we have a distance.  A first question to ask is
whether a suitable tree representation exists for a given dataset and distance
function.  As we will see, when the distance function satisfies certain
properties there always exists a tree representation and this representation
is also unique.  We focus then on a slightly different problem: imagine we
know the distance between only certain pairs of objects in our dataset.  We
call this information a partial distance.  This presents two separate
problems.  First, does there exist a tree representation of a given partial
distance and if so, can we find one?  Second, does there exist a unique tree
representation of a given partial distance, and if so can we find it?  These
issues are the subject of the remained on this thesis.

\subsection{Basic terminology and assumptions}
\label{sec:basic-term-assumpt}

In this section we introduce much of the terminology that is required for
dealing with trees.  Since trees are special cases of graphs, we begin with
general graph theory before moving on to trees and then special type of trees
that are of greatest interest to us.  As noted by Knuth \cite{knuth97taocp1}
there is a large degree of variation in the terminology used by different
authors in graph theory.  We try to follow the terminology used in current
phylogenetics literature such as \cite{semple2003phylogenetics} and
\cite{DHS11}.  Throughout this section, let $X$ denote a finite nonempty set.

\subsubsection{Graphs}
\label{sec:graphs}

A \textit{graph} is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of
\textit{vertices} and $E$ is a set (or multiset) of \textit{edges}, each of
the form $\{x,y\}$ such that $x,y \in V$ are distinct.  Unless specified
otherwise, all graphs in this thesis are \textit{simple} and finite meaning
that $V$ and $E$ are finite sets and there are no loops.  Suppose $G = (V,E)$
is a graph. Two vertices $v,v' \in V$ are said to be \textit{adjacent} if
there exists an edge in $G$ joining $v$ and $v'$.  An edge $\{x,y\} \in E$ is
said to be \textit{incident} with the vertices $x$ and $y$.  The
\textit{degree} of a vertex $v \in V$ is the number of edges in $G$ incident
with it.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/background2/graph-ex.pdft}
  \caption{A graph (left) and a directed graph (right).}
  \label{fig:graph-ex}
\end{figure}

A \textit{path} is a sequence of distinct vertices $v_1,v_2,\dotsc,v_k$ where
$k \geq 2$ such that for all $i \in \{1,\dotsc,k-1\}, v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ are
adjacent.  If $k \geq 3$ and $v_1$ and $v_k$ are also adjacent then the path
is called a \textit{cycle}.  A graph is \textit{connected} if there exists a
path joining each pair of distinct vertices.  A graph is \textit{complete} if
there is an edge joining each pair of distinct vertices.
Figure~\ref{fig:graph-ex} helps to illustrate these definitions.  In the graph
shown in the figure an example of a path is $g,f,e,d$ and an example of a
cycle is $g,f,a,b,g$.  Both graphs are connected, but are not complete.

A \textit{directed graph} is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of
\textit{directed edges} or \textit{arcs}.  An arc $(v,v') \in E$ is said to
lead from $v$ to $v'$.  The \textit{out-degree} of a vertex is the number of
arcs leading out from it and the \textit{in-degree} is the number leading in.
The degree of a vertex is therefore the sum of its out-degree and in-degree.
An \textit{oriented path} is a sequence of distinct vertices $v_1,\dotsc,v_k$
such that there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k-1$.
Figure~\ref{fig:graph-ex} shows a directed graph to help illustrate these
definitions.  Vertex $f$ has out-degree 3, in-degree 1 and therefore degree 4.
An example of an oriented path is $e,f,b,c$.

Two graphs $(V,E)$ and $(V',E')$ are called \textit{isomorphic} if there
exists a bijection $\phi \colon V \to V'$ such that $\{v,v'\} \in E$ if and
only if $\{\phi(v),\phi(v')\} \in E'$.  So, in other words, adjacency of
vertices is preserved.  A graph $(V',E')$ is a \textit{subgraph} of a graph
$(V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.  Further if $V' \subseteq V$
and $E'$ contains all edges $\{v,v'\} \in E$ whenever $v,v' \in V'$, $(V',E')$
is an \textit{induced subgraph} of $(V,E)$.

\subsubsection{Trees}
\label{sec:trees}

A graph that is connected and has no cycles is called a \textit{tree}.  Trees can be
characterised in many ways, some of which are given in the following theorem
(see \citep[][Section 2.3.4.1]{knuth97taocp1} for a proof):

\begin{thm}
  If $G$ is a finite graph with exactly $n > 0$ vertices, the following
  statements are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item $G$ is a tree,
  \item $G$ is connected, but if any edge is deleted the resulting graph is no
    longer connected,
  \item There is exactly one path between any two distinct vertices of $G$,
  \item $G$ contains no cycles and has $n-1$ edges,
  \item $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

A \textit{rooted tree} (or \textit{oriented tree}) is a graph $G$
with a distinguished vertex $\rho_G$ (the root) such that
\cite{knuth97taocp1}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Each vertex $v$ of $G$ apart from $\rho_G$ has in-degree 1,
\item The root $\rho_G$ has in-degree 0,
\item There is a path between $\rho_G$ and any vertex of $G$ that is not the
  root.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/background2/x-tree-ex.pdft}
  \caption{An $X$-tree (left) and a rooted $X'$-tree (right).}
  \label{fig:x-tree-ex}
\end{figure}

A vertex in a tree is called a \textit{leaf} if it has degree 1.  All other
vertices are called \textit{interior} vertices.  An edge which is incident
with a leaf is called a \textit{pendant} edge.  All other edges are called
\textit{interior} edges.

Suppose $X$ is a finite, nonempty set, a \textit{phylogenetic $X$-tree}
($X$-tree for short) is a tree with no degree 2 vertices and set of leaves
$X$.  A \textit{rooted phylogenetic $X$-tree} (rooted $X$-tree for short) is a
rooted tree with no degree 2 vertices except possibly the root and with leaf
set $X$.  Figure~\ref{fig:x-tree-ex} shows an $X$-tree with $X =
\{a,\dotsc,g\}$ and a rooted $X'$-tree with $X' = \{a,\dotsc,f\}$.

An \textit{edge-weighted graph} $(G,\omega)$ is a graph $G=(V,E)$ paired with
an edge-weighting function $\omega \colon E \to \rr$.  For an edge-weighted
tree $T$ we call an edge-weighting \textit{proper} if $w(e) > 0$ for every
edge $e$ of $T$.

A rooted tree has a natural partial order on the vertices.  Given a tree
$T=(V,E)$, a vertex $v \in V$ is an \textit{ancestor} of a vertex $v' \in V$
if and only if $v$ is on the path from the root of $T$ to $v'$.  The vertex
$v'$ is then said to be a \textit{descendant} of $v$.  If $v$ and $v'$ are
adjacent then we also call $v$ the \textit{parent} of $v'$ and $v'$ a
\textit{child} of $v$.  The number of children of a particular vertex equals
its out-degree.

We call two $X$-trees $T,T'$ \textit{equivalent} (written $T \simeq T'$) if
there exists a bijection $\phi \colon V(T) \to V(T')$ which preserves
adjacency and is the identity on $X$.  If the $X$-tree is rooted then $\phi$
must also map $\rho_{T}$ to $\rho_{T'}$.  This means that $T,T'$ are
necessarily isomorphic.

A tree in which all interior vertices have degree 3 is called \textit{binary}.
A rooted tree is binary if all interior vertices have degree 3 apart from the
root which has degree 2.  If a rooted tree is viewed as a directed graph with
arcs directed away from the root then each vertex has out-degree zero or two
and each vertex apart from the root has in-degree 1
\cite{semple2003phylogenetics}.

The \textit{lowest common ancestor} of two vertices $v$ and $v'$ in a rooted
tree is the unique vertex $u$ such that $u$ is an ancestor of both $v$ and
$v'$ and the path from the root $\rho$ to $u$ is longer than the path to any
other ancestor of both $v$ and $v'$.  The lowest common ancestor of $v$ and
$v'$ is denoted $\lca(v,v')$.  In the rooted $X'$-tree in
Figure~\ref{fig:x-tree-ex}, the lowest common ancestor of $a$ and $d$ is the
root $\rho$.

A connected subgraph of a tree is called a \textit{subtree}.  If $T$ is an
$X$-tree and $X' \subseteq X$ then we denote by $T|X'$ the subtree of $T$
whose leaf set is $X'$, with degree 2 vertices suppressed.  $T|X'$ is then
called a \textit{restricted subtree}.  If $T$ is binary and $|X'| = 3$ then
$T|X'$ is called a \textit{triplet}.

The number of possible binary $X$-trees is $(2|X|-5)!!$ and the number of
possible rooted binary $X$-trees is $(2|X|-3)!!$
\cite{felsenstein2004inferring}.  Therefore to find a tree in this space with
particular properties we cannot look at each possible tree and must instead
use a special tree construction method.  Next we look at how distances are
related to trees and then at the problem of constructing a tree from distance
information.

\subsubsection{Distances}
\label{sec:distances}

Given an edge-weighted $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ where $T=(V,E)$ and $\omega
\colon E \to \rr$ we can associate a distance $D_{(T,\omega)} \colon X \times
X \to \rr$ to $(T,\omega)$ by setting for all $x,y \in X$:
\begin{equation*}
  D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle
    \sum_{e \in P(x,y)} \omega(e) & \text{if $x \neq y$},\\
    0 & \text{otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $P(x,y)$ is the set of edges on the path from $x$ to $y$.  We call
$D_{(T,\omega)}$ the distance \textit{induced} by $(T,\omega)$.  A distance
$\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ is called a \textit{tree metric} if there
exists an $X$-tree $T=(V,E)$ with edge-weighting $\omega \colon E \to \rr$
such that $\delta(x,y) = D_{(T,\omega)}$ for all $x,y \in X$.  So for any
edge-weighted $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$, the distance $D_{(T,\omega)}$ is a tree
metric.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/background2/quartet.pdft}
  \caption{An $X$-tree with four leaves used to illustrate the four-point
    condition.}
  \label{fig:quartet-tree}
\end{figure}

The \textit{four-point condition} allows us to decide whether a given distance
function is in fact a tree metric \cite{semple2003phylogenetics}.  A distance
$\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ satisfies the four-point condition if for
every $w,x,y,z \in X$ the following holds:
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(w,x) + \delta(y,z) \leq \max(\delta(w,y)+\delta(x,z),
                                      \delta(w,z)+\delta(x,y)).
\end{equation*}
Since the elements $w,x,y,z$ need not be distinct it is easy to see that if
$\delta$ satisfies the four-point condition then it satisfies the triangle
inequality and is therefore a metric.  Further, $\delta$ is a tree metric on
$X$ if and only if it satisfies the four-point condition
\citep[Theorem 7.2.6]{semple2003phylogenetics}.

To illustrate the fact that an induced distance $D_{(T,\omega)}$ must satisfy
the four-point condition let $T$ be the tree shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:quartet-tree} and $\omega$ be any proper edge-weighting for
it.  Then it is easy to see that $\DTw(w,x)+\DTw(y,z) < \DTw(w,y)+\DTw(x,z)$
by observing the dotted and dashed lines.  Also $\DTw(w,y)+\DTw(x,z) =
\DTw(w,z)+\DTw(x,y)$, so the distanced induced by $T$ and $\omega$ on
$\{w,x,y,z\}$ satisfies the four-point condition.

An important property of tree metrics is that for any tree metric $\delta
\colon X \times X \to \rr$ there is, up to isomorphism, a unique edge-weighted
$X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ for which $\delta(x,y) = D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y)$ for all
$x,y \in X$.  This tree can be recovered from the metric in polynomial time
\citep{semple2003phylogenetics}.  We will see some of the methods for doing
this in Section~\ref{sec:constr-from-dist}.

A distance $\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ is called an
\textit{ultrametric} if for every distinct $x,y,z \in X$ the following holds:
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(x,y) \leq \max(\delta(x,z),\delta(y,z)).
\end{equation*}
Any ultrametric satisfies the four-point condition and is therefore also a
tree metric.

     \end{tikzpicture}
   \end{subfigure}

   \caption{Two different ways to draw an edge-weighted $X$-tree.}
   \label{fig:example-equidistant}
\end{figure}

An edge-weighting $\omega \colon E \to \rr$ for a rooted $X$-tree $T=(V,E)$ is
called \textit{equidistant} if it satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $D_{(T,\omega)}(\rho_T,x) = D_{(T,\omega)}(\rho_T,y)$ for all $x,y
  \in X$,
\item[(ii)] $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) \geq D_{(T,\omega)}(x,v)$ for all $x \in X$
  and any $u,v \in V$ whenever $v$ is encountered first on the path from $x$
  to $\rho$.
\end{itemize}
If $\omega$ is an equidistant edge-weighting then $D_{(T,w)}$ is an
ultrametric \citep{semple2003phylogenetics}.  Rooted $X$-trees with
equidistant edge-weightings arise naturally in many places, for example in
phylogenetics.  For convenience we will from now on refer to such a rooted
$X$-tree with equidistant edge-weighting as simply an \textit{equidistant
  $X$-tree}.  Figure~\ref{fig:example-equidistant} shows an example of an
equidistant $X$-tree using two common display formats.

For any ultrametric $\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ there is, up to
isomorphism, a unique equidistant $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ such that $\delta(x,y)
= D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$.  As with a general tree metric,
this tree can be recovered from the ultrametric in polynomial time.

\section{Tree construction}
\label{sec:tree-construction}

In this section we look at various methods of constructing trees.  Of most
interest to us is the problem of constructing an $X$-tree from a dissimilarity
on $X$.  This is generally done by one of two broad classes of hierarchical
clustering methods which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:hier-clust-meth}.

A further problem is that of constructing an edge-weighted $X$-tree from a
dissimilarity on $X$.  This is desirable in many cases, for example in
phylogenetics the edge-weights might represent the time or number of point
mutations \cite{felsenstein2004inferring}.

Given a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr_{\geq 0}$ and a weighted
$X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ produced by some construction method, we call that
method \textit{consistent} if it satisfies the property that whenever $d$ is a
tree metric on $X$ then $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$.
In other words, if given a tree metric the construction method produced the
unique edge-weighted tree identified by the tree metric.

Closely related to this is the problem of constructing $X$-trees from only
partial distance information.  This means that we do not have the
dissimilarity $d$, but rather only have the values $d(x,y)$ for some, but not
all, pairs $x,y \in X$.  This problem is motivated by the fact that accurate
distance measurements are often difficult or impossible to obtain in practice
but one would still like to build a tree given only what is known.

As with complete distance information, it is possible for partial distance
information to uniquely determine an $X$-tree.  This is the subject of
Section~\ref{sec:lassoing-corralling}.  This means that we can essentially
speak of consistency with regards to partial distance construction methods.
Such methods appear in Chapters~\ref{cha:dist-minim-topl} and
\ref{cha:lasso-construction}.

\subsection{Construction from subtrees}
\label{sec:constr-from-subtr}

Before we look at constructing trees from distances, it is interesting to note
that we do not actually need a distance to construct only the topology of a
rooted $X$-tree.  It suffices merely to know the set of subtrees displayed by
the tree.  

A pair of leaves of a rooted $X$-tree that share the same parent is called a
\textit{cherry}.  A rooted $X$-tree with $|X| = 3$ that contains a cherry is
called a \textit{triplet}.  If $X = \{a,b,c\}$ and $a,b$ is a cherry then we
denote the triplet by $ab|c$.  We say that a triplet $ab|c$ is
\textit{displayed} by a tree $T$ if $T|\{a,b,c\}$ is binary and $lca_T(a,c) =
lca_T(b,c)$ is an ancestor of $lca_T(a,b)$ in $T$.

The \textsc{Build} algorithm \cite{aho1981inferring} can reconstruct a rooted
$X$-tree $T$ from the set of all triplets displayed by it, that is the set
$\{T|S \colon S \subseteq X, |S| = 3 \text{ and } T|S \text{ is binary}\}$.
Let $T$ be a rooted $X$-tree and $R$ be a set of rooted trees
$\{T|X_1,\dotsc,T|X_n\}$ where $X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n = X$.  The
\textsc{Build} algorithm uses an auxiliary graph $[R,S]$ which has vertex set
$S \subseteq X$ and an edge $\{a,b\}$ for each $a,b \in S$ whenever there
exists a $c \in S$ and a $T' \in R$ such that $T'|\{a,b,c\} = ab|c$ (a
triplet).

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{\textsc{Build}.}
  \label{alg:build}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set of rooted trees $R = \{T|X_1,\dotsc,T|X_n\}$.
    \Ensure  An $X$-tree $T$ where $X = X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n$.

    \State $S = \{x_1,\dotsc,x_m\} \gets X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n$.

    \If{$|S| = 1$} \Return the tree $(\{x_1\},\emptyset)$. \EndIf

    \If{$|S| = 2$} let $\rho$ be a new vertex and \Return the tree with root
    node $\rho$ obtained by attaching $x_1$ and $x_2$ to $\rho$. \EndIf

    \State Construct the graph $[R,S]$.

    \State Let $S_1,\dotsc,S_k$ be the vertex sets of the connected components
    of $[R,S]$.

    \ForAll{$1 \leq i \leq k$}
    \State Let $T_i$ be the output of \textsc{Build} on $R_i$ where $R_i =
    \{T|S_i \colon T \in R\}$.
    \EndFor

    \State Let $\rho$ be a new vertex and \Return the tree with root node
    $\rho$ obtained by attaching the root of each $T_i$ to $\rho$.
    
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/background2/build-ex2.pdft}
  \caption{An illustration of the \textsc{Build} algorithm.}
  \label{fig:build-ex}
\end{figure}

The \textsc{Build} algorithm is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:build}.  We
illustrate the algorithm in Figure~\ref{fig:build-ex} with an input of $R =
\{T_1,T_2\}$.  $[R,S]$ is the auxiliary graph built in the first iteration of
the algorithm and $T$ is the final tree constructed.

If \textsc{Build} returns a tree then the set of input trees is said to be
\textit{compatible}.  If we input the set of all triplets displayed by a tree
$T$, then \textsc{Build} will output $T$ \cite{semple2003phylogenetics}.  The
case where the inputted set of triplets is some subset of all the triplets
displayed by a tree is discussed in \cite[Section
2.5.2]{bryant97buildingtrees}.

The \textsc{Build} algorithm was initially developed to construct a tree
satisfying a given set of lineage constraints and was applied to problems
arising in the theory of relational databases.  It was later applied to
phylogenetics but remained relatively unknown in the field for a number of
years \cite{steel1992complexity,bryant04supertree}.

\subsection{Construction from distances}
\label{sec:constr-from-dist}

We now turn to the problem of constructing a tree from a distance function.
We begin by looking at the problem of constructing rooted trees and then look
at one method for the more general problem of constructing unrooted trees.

The hierarchical clustering methods build rooted trees which are generally
binary and without edge-weightings.  UPGMA \cite{sokal1958statistical} can be
considered an extension which also builds an equidistant edge-weighting.
Neighbor-joining \cite{saitou1987nj} is a popular method which constructs an
edge-weighted binary unrooted tree.

For a distance-based construction method the following property is desirable:
if we input a distance function $D_{(T,\omega)}$ we get the tree $T$ and its
edge-weighting $\omega$.  If a method holds this property then we call it
\textit{consistent}.  For many methods this property holds only under certain
conditions.  For UPGMA this holds only if $(T,\omega)$ is a binary equidistant
$X$-tree and for Neighbor-joining only if $(T,\omega)$ is binary
\cite{semple2003phylogenetics}.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical clustering methods}
\label{sec:hier-clust-meth}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/background2/tree-clust-ex.pdft}
  \caption{A tree can be viewed as a hierarchy of partitions.}
  \label{fig:tree-clust-ex}
\end{figure}

Hierarchical clustering is used for the classification of information in much
the same way as partitional clustering.  The aim is to produce a rooted
$X$-tree corresponding to a dataset $X$ and dissimilarity on $X$.  While a
partition of a dataset is merely a set of subsets which cover the dataset, an
$X$-tree can be viewed as a hierarchy of such clusters which induces several
partitions on $X$.  This natural relationship between trees and partitions is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tree-clust-ex}.

There are two main methods in use for building hierarchies, these are the
agglomerative or bottom-up method which begins with each element of $X$ in its
own cluster and successively merges clusters until there is only one, and the
divisive or top-down method which begins with a single cluster and
successively splits clusters until each element is on its own.  The resulting
hierarchy depends upon which merges or splits have been chosen at each stage,
and this depends on finding a local optimum according to some criterion.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.}
  \label{alg:agglomerative}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$, and a
    linkage function $D \colon 2^X \times 2^X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A rooted $X$-tree $T$.

    \State Let $F$ be a forest of $|X|$ trees each containing a unique element
    of $X$ as the only vertex, which is also the root,

    \While{$|F| > 1$}

       \State Let $v$ be a new vertex and $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmin_{x,y
         \in F} D(L(x),L(y))$ (where $L(x)$ denotes the leafset of $x$),
       \State Remove trees $x$ and $y$ from $F$ and add the tree obtained by
         attaching the roots of $x$ and $y$ to $v$ and letting $v$ be the root,
    
    \EndWhile

    \State \Return the single tree contained in $F$.
    
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The general algorithm for agglomerative clustering is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:agglomerative}.  The choice of linkage function determines
which trees are joined at each stage.  Given a set $X$ and dissimilarity $d
\colon X \times X \to \rr$ and two nonempty subsets $S_1,S_2 \subseteq X$,
some common choices for linkage functions include single-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:slink}
  D_{SL}(S_1,S_2) = \min_{x \in S_1, y \in S_2} d(x,y),
\end{equation}
complete-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:clink}
  D_{CL}(S_1,S_2) = \max_{x \in S_1, y \in S_2} d(x,y),
\end{equation}
and average-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:alink}
  D_{AL}(S_1,S_2) = \left( \sum_{x \in S_1} \sum_{y \in S_2} d(x,y) \right) / |S_1| |S_2|.
\end{equation}

The general algorithm for agglomerative clustering has runtime complexity of
$O(n^3)$ where $n = |X|$ since there are $O(n)$ merges to be done and finding
the $\argmin$ takes $O(n^2)$ time.  However, for all three of the linkage
functions above there are special algorithms which run in only $O(n^2)$ time,
these are SLINK \citep{sibson1973slink}, CLINK \citep{defays1977efficient} and
UPGMA \citep{sokal1958statistical} respectively.

The divisive method is very similar in nature but it requires a more difficult
decision about how to split a cluster.  A divisive algorithm may also
terminate before $|X|$ clusters have been obtained in which case the order in
which the clusters are split becomes important.  A naïve approach is to always
split the largest cluster first, but there are more complicated approaches
based instead on cluster homogeneity.  Once it has been decided to split a
cluster, a partitional clustering algorithm can be used to perform the split
\citep{ding2002cluster}.

\subsubsection{UPGMA}
\label{sec:upgma}

The UPGMA algorithm is in fact a modified agglomerative clustering algorithm
using average-linkage which constructs an edge-weighted rooted $X$-tree.  The
edge-weighting constructed by UPGMA is always equidistant.

For an equidistant $X$-tree $x = (T,\omega)$, let $height(x)$ be the length of
the path from the root of $T$ to any leaf, that is $\sum_{e \in P}
D_{(T,\omega)}$ where $P$ is a path from $\rho_T$ to a leaf in $X$, or 0 if
the root is the sole vertex.  The algorithm for UPGMA is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:upgma}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{UPGMA.}
  \label{alg:upgma}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, and a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A binary equidistant $X$-tree $(T, \omega)$.

    \State Let $F$ be a forest of $|X|$ trees each containing a unique element
    of $X$ as the only vertex, which is also the root.

    \While{$|F| > 1$}

       \State Let $v$ be a new vertex,
       \State put $\displaystyle m \gets \min_{x,y \in F} D_{AL}(L(x),L(y))$,
       \State and $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmin_{x,y \in F} D_{AL}(L(x),L(y))$.
       \State Remove trees $x$ and $y$ from $F$ and add the tree obtained by
         attaching the root of $x$ to $v$ with an edge of length $m/2 -
         height(x)$, attaching the root of $y$ to $v$ with an edge of length
         $m/2 - height(y)$ and letting $v$ be the root.
    
    \EndWhile

    \State \Return the $X$-tree contained in $F$ and its edge-weighting.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Since only two trees are joined in each iteration, the output of UPGMA is
always a binary tree.  If the input $d$ is equal to some $D_{(T,\omega)}$ then
the output of UPGMA will will $(T,\omega)$.

\subsubsection{Neighbor-joining}
\label{sec:neighbour-joining}

Neighbor-joining is a method for building an edge-weighted unrooted $X$-tree
which, like UPGMA, is consistent if the dissimilarity identifies a binary tree
but, unlike UPGMA, the consistency holds for general tree metrics
\cite{saitou1987nj}.  The algorithm works by replacing a cherry by a single
vertex and recursively applying Neighbor-joining to the resulting tree.
Neighbor-joining is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:neighbour-joining}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Neighbor-joining.}
  \label{alg:neighbour-joining}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, and a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A binary $X$-tree $T$ and edge-weighting $\omega$.

    \If{$|X| = 2$} Let $X = \{x,y\}$ and \Return the tree obtained by joining
    $x$ and $y$ with an edge of length $d(x,y)$.
    \EndIf

    \State $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmax_{x,y \in X} \left( d(x,y) + \frac{1}{2}
    \sum_{r \in X - \{x,y\}} (d(r,x)+d(r,y)-d(x,y))\right)$.

    \State $X' \gets X - \{x,y\} \cup \{v\}$ where $v \notin X$.

    \State Define a dissimilarity $d' \colon X' \times X' \to \rr$ by:
    \begin{equation*}
      d'(p,q) =
      \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if $p,q \notin X$} \\
        (d(x,p)+d(y,p)-d(x,y))/2 & \text{if $p \in X, q \notin X$} \\
        (d(x,q)+d(y,q)-d(x,y))/2 & \text{if $p \notin X, q \in X$} \\
        d(p,q) & \text{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    \State Let $(T',\omega')$ be the tree obtained by applying
    Neighbor-joining to $X'$ and $d'$.

    \State Attach $x$ and $y$ to the leaf vertex $v$ of $T'$ to obtain a tree
    $T$, put $\omega \gets \omega'$.

    \State Put $\displaystyle \omega(\{v,x\}) \gets \frac{1}{2} d(x,y) +
    \frac{1}{2(|X|-2)} \sum_{u \in X} (d(u,x)-d(u,y))$.

    \State Put $\omega(\{v,y\}) \gets d(x,y) - \omega(\{v,x\})$.

    \State \Return $(T,\omega)$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Construction from partial dissimilarities}
\label{sec:constr-from-part}

A partial dissimilarity is one defined for only a subset of all pairs of
elements.  Let $M \subseteq X^2$ be the set of all pairs of elements for which
we do not know the dissimilarity.  We have only a function $d^* \colon X^2 - M
\to \rr$ or a $|X|^2$ dissimilarity matrix in which there are ``holes'' or
pairs labelled as ``unknown''.

Partial dissimilarities arise often in practice.  It is sometimes difficult or
impossible to make measurements between certain pairs due to those pairs not
sharing any information from which a distance can be inferred.  For example,
in biological studies involving large numbers of species and genes it is often
the case that species do not share any genes in the available
data\cite{criscuolo2008fastnj}.

For this reason it becomes useful to ask whether such a partial dissimilarity
can be extended into a complete dissimilarity that is also a tree metric or
ultrametric.  Put differently we would like to find some $d \colon X^2 \to
\rr$ for which $d(x,y) = d^*(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in X^2 - M$ and which is a
tree metric or ultrametric.  In \citep{farach1995robust} it was shown that the
problem of deciding whether such an extension to a tree metric exists is
NP-complete but the special case of an extension to an ultrametric is in P.

Below we describe three different methods given in the literature for
extending a partial dissimilarity to an ultrametric and constructing a rooted
$X$-tree.  There are also many methods that have been devised for the more
general problem of extension to a tree metric which we do not review but can
be found in, for example, \citep{guenoche1999approximations},
\citep{farach1995robust}, \citep{makarenkov2001nouvelle} and
\citep{guenoche2004extension}.

\subsubsection{An optimisation method}
\label{sec:part-dist-optim-method}

The approach taken by \citet{de1984ultrametric} is to consider a least squares
constrained optimisation problem.  Given a partial dissimilarity $d^* \colon
X^2 - M \to \rr$ we wish to find a function $d \colon X^2 \to \rr$
such that
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:partial-dist-least-squares}
  Loss(d) = \sum_{(x,y) \in X^2 - M} (d^*(x,y)-d(x,y))^2
\end{equation*}
is minimised and $d$ is an ultrametric.  The method used is a sequential
unconstrained minimisation technique.  The constraint that $d$ must be an
ultrametric is removed and instead we find a dissimilarity $d_n \colon X^2 \to
\rr$ which minimises the augmented function:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:partial-dist-optimisation}
  \Phi(d_n,\sigma) = Loss(d_n) + \sigma Pen(d_n), \qquad (\sigma > 0).
\end{equation*}
The function $Loss$ is called the \textit{loss function} and $Pen$ is the
\textit{penalty function} which is meant to enforce the ultrametric
condition.  $Pen$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:penalty-function}
  Pen(d_n) = \sum_{(i,j,k) \in \Omega(d_n)} (d_n(i,k) - d_n(j,k))^2
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \Omega(d_n) = \{(i,j,k) \in X^3 \colon d(i,j) \leq \min(d_n(i,k),d_n(j,k))
  \text{ and } d_n(i,k) \neq d_n(j,k)\}.
\end{equation*}
In other words, $\Omega(d_n)$ denotes the set of triples for which the
ultrametric condition is violated.  The unconstrained minimisation is
performed successively with an increasing value for $\sigma$, each time using
the previous result $d_{n-1}$ to begin the search for the next $d_n$.  To
perform the unconstrained minimisation of the augmented function, a method by
\citet{powell1977restart} is used.

\subsubsection{An agglomerative method}
\label{sec:part-dist-agglom-method}

The method used by \citet{schader1992mvl}, which they call Missing Values
Linkage (MVL), is actually identical to the agglomerative hierarchical
clustering algorithm shown in Section~\ref{sec:hier-clust-meth} but using a
linkage criterion modified to take into account missing values.  The modified
average-linkage criterion for two nonempty sets $S_1, S_2$ is:
\begin{equation*}
  D_{MVL}(S_1,S_2) =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle
    \frac{(\sum_{(x,y) \in S_1 \times S_2 - M} d(x,y)}{|S_1 \times S_2 - M|} & \text{if $S_1
      \times S_2 - M \neq \emptyset$,} \\
    \infty & \text{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $M = \{(i,j) \in X^2 \colon d(i,j) \text{ is unknown}\}$.  Modified
versions of other linkage criteria are possible.

The authors do not provide an algorithm with better time complexity than that
of the naïve agglomerative algorithm ($O(n^3)$).  They also show that the MVL
method produces very similar results to \citeauthor{de1984ultrametric}'s
method.

\subsubsection{A divisive method}
\label{sec:part-dist-divisive-method}

\citet{farach1995robust} use a top down, divisive approach.  Given a partial
distance function $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$ let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with
vertex set $X$ and an edge $\{x,y\}$ with $x,y \in X$ whenever $x \neq y$ and
$d(x,y)$ is known.  We also define an edge-weighting $\omega \colon E \to \rr$
by $\omega(\{x,y\}) = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in E$.

The tree construction algorithm proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $E = \emptyset$, return the single element in $V$.
\item Otherwise, put $m \gets max_{e \in E} \omega(e)$.
\item Let $G^* = (V,E^*)$ be a graph and put $E^* \gets \{e \in E \colon
  \omega(e) < m\}$.
\item Let $u$ be a new vertex and return the tree with root node $u$ obtained
  by recursing on each connected component of $G^*$ and attaching the results
  of each to $u$.
\end{enumerate}
This basic algorithm shown here requires $O(|V||E|)$ time but a quicker
algorithm requiring only $O(|E| + |V|\log |V|)$ time is also given by
\citet{farach1995robust}.

\section{Lassos}
\label{sec:lassoing-corralling}

All of the methods for constructing a tree from a partial dissimilarity listed
in Section~\ref{sec:constr-from-part} have one thing in common: the tree
produced in undefined when more than one extension to an ultrametric is
possible.

Certain partial distances have the property that they uniquely determine the
topology or edge-weights of one tree or, in other words, only one extension to
an ultrametric is possible.  To enable us to understand when partial
dissimilarities have this uniqueness property, the theory of lassos was
developed.

\subsection{Definitions and basic properties}
\label{sec:defin-basic-prop}

Let $(T,\omega), (T',\omega')$ be two edge-weighted $X$-trees and $\cL
\subseteq {X \choose 2}$ be some subset of pairs of leaves in $X$.  For
convenience we denote an element $\{x,y\} \in \cL$ as simply $xy$.
$(T,\omega), (T',\omega')$ are called \textit{$\cL$-isometric} if
$D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) = D_{(T',\omega')}(x,y)$ for all $xy \in \cL$.

Now, given an $X$-tree $T$ and a subset $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$ we
define $\cL$ to be:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item an \textit{edge-weight lasso} if $\omega = \omega'$ holds for all proper
  edge-weightings $\omega,\omega'$ of $T$ where $(T,\omega),(T,\omega')$ are
  $\cL$-isometric,
\item a \textit{topological lasso} if $T \simeq T'$ holds for any $X$-tree
  $T'$ for which there exist proper edge-weightings $\omega,\omega'$ of $T,T'$
  respectively where $(T,\omega),(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$-isometric,
\item a \textit{strong lasso} if $(T,\omega) \equiv (T',\omega')$ holds for
  every given proper edge-weighting $\omega$ and any edge-weighted $X$-tree
  $(T',\omega')$ where $(T,\omega),(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$-isometric.
\end{enumerate}

For further information and discussion about lassos, especially those
concerning general $X$-trees, the reader is referred to \citep{DHS11}.

\subsection{Characterising lassos: the child-edge graph}
\label{sec:lassoing-rooted-x}

Lassos for rooted $X$-trees can be characterised using a graph associated to
each interior vertex of a tree \citep{HP13}.  First, a lasso $\cL$ of $X$
which satisfies the property that $\bigcup_{c \in \cL} c = X$ is called a
\textit{covering} of $X$.  Let $T$ be an $X$-tree and $\iV(T)$ denote the set
of internal vertices of $T$.  For some $v \in \iV(T)$, and a set of cords $\cL
\subseteq {X \choose 2}$, we associate a graph called $G(\cL,v)$ defined as
follows.  The vertex set of the graph $V_v$ is the set of all child edges of
$v$.  The edge set $E_V$ is the set of all $\{e,e'\} \in {V_v \choose 2}$ for
which there exist leaves $a,b \in X$ and a cord $ab \in \cL$ such that $e$ and
$e'$ are edges on the path from $a$ to $b$ in $T$.  We call the graph
$G(\cL,v)$ the \textit{child-edge graph} (\textit{of $v$ with respect to $T$
  and $\cL$}).

We have the following characterisation of topological lassos which originally
appeared in \cite{HP13}:
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:child-edge-graph-complete}
  Suppose $T$ is an $X$-tree and $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$ is a covering
  of $X$.  Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\cL$ is a topological lasso for $T$,
  \item for every vertex $v \in \iV(T)$, the graph $G(\cL,v)$ is complete.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

Due to the characterisation of edge-weight lassos also presented in
\cite{HP13}, we also have that every topological lasso for $T$ must also be an
edge-weight lasso, and therefore a strong lasso, for $T$.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{figures/background2/lasso-example.pdft}
\end{center}
\caption{Two equidistant $X$-trees.  All edges have weight 1 except bold edges
  which have weight 2.  For $\cL=\{ac,de,bc,ce,cd\}$ both trees induce the
  same distances over the cords in $\cL$ despite having different topologies.
  In this case $\cL$ is not a topological lasso.}
\label{fig:lasso-example}
\end{figure}

To illustrate some of these concepts consider the two equidistant rooted
$X$-trees $(T,\omega),(T',\omega')$ in Figure~\ref{fig:lasso-example}.  The
edge-weights on the edges are proportional to the length of the edges as shown
and induce distances $D_{(T,\omega)} \colon X \times X \to \rr$ and
$D_{(T',\omega')} \colon X \times X \to \rr$ respectively.  The trees are
therefore equidistant.  If we have the set of cords $\cL=\{ac,de,bc,ce,cd\}$
then notice that the distances between each of these pairs of leaves is the
same according to the induced distances for both trees.  Therefore $\cL$ is
not a topological lasso.  Notice that this property of $\cL$ is dependent
solely on the structure of the set itself and not on the actual distances on
the trees.
