\section{Graphs, Trees and Distances}
\label{sec:graphs-trees-dist}

\subsection{History}
\label{sec:history}

Trees have been used to represent hierarchical structures for many hundreds of
years.  One of the most well-known and ubiquitous occurrences is that of the
family tree.  The use of a tree to represent lineages seems to have begun with
Christian artwork of the 12th Century depicting the ancestors of Jesus of
Nazareth.  This tree is known as the Tree of Jesse.

Darwin would later popularise the concept of the more general ``tree of life''
in his seminal work \textit{On the Origin of Species}.  Instead of
representing the lineages of individuals, Darwin's trees showed the lineages
of species and the hierarchies formed by the process called natural selection
(Figure~\ref{fig:darwin-tree}).

    \textit{First notebook on transmutation of species}, 1837.}

\end{figure}

Trees as a formally defined mathematical entity, such as the ones will see in
the following sections, appeared as early as 1847 with the name ``tree''
appearing in the literature shortly afterwards \cite{knuth97taocp1}.  The more
general theory of graphs and topology was developed earlier and is considered
to have begun with Euler who in 1735 presented the paper ``Solutio problematis
ad geometriam situs pertinentis'' in which it was shown that it was not
possible to walk through the city of KÃ¶nigsburg crossing each of its seven
bridges exactly once.

Tree structures have been of great importance in computer programming.  They
were first used explicitly to represent algebraic formulae for the purpose of
symbolic differentiation \citep{kahrimanian53differentiation}.  This would
later become the field of computer algebra which would drive the development
of computer science and especially programming languages for many years.

It should be clear that it makes sense to organise many different types of
information into trees.  This presents a number of problems.  First we may
ask: does there exist a unique tree representation of a given dataset?  Unlike
the partition problem there are some datasets for which a unique and
well-defined tree representation exists.  It is possible both to construct the
tree from such a dataset, and to recover the dataset from the tree.  If such a
unique representation does exist our second question is: how can we find it?
These issues will be the subject of the remainder of this thesis.

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

In this section we introduce much of the terminology that is required for
dealing with trees.  Since trees are special cases of graphs, we begin with
general graph theory before moving on to trees and then special type of trees
that are of greatest interest to us.

\subsubsection{Graphs}
\label{sec:graphs}

A \textit{graph} is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of
\textit{vertices} and $E$ is a set (or multiset) of \textit{edges}, each of
the form $\{x,y\}$ such that $x,y \in V$ are distinct.  Unless specified
otherwise, all graphs in this thesis are \textit{simple} and finite meaning
that $V$ and $E$ are finite sets.  Two vertices $v,v' \in V$ are said to be
\textit{adjacent} if there exists an edge $\{v,v'\} \in E$.  A \textit{path}
is a sequence of vertices $v_1,v_2,\dotsc,v_k$ such that for all $i \in
\{1,2,\dotsc,k-1\}, v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ are adjacent.  If $v_1$ and $v_k$ are
also adjacent then the path is called a \textit{cycle}.  A graph is
\textit{connected} if there exists a path joining each pair of vertices in
$V$.

An edge $\{x,y\} \in E$ is said to be \textit{incident} with the vertices $x$
and $y$.  The \textit{degree} of a vertex is the number of edges in the graph
incident with it.

Directed graphs, in/out degree. in+out = degree.

Figure~\ref{graph-examples} illustrates these definitions.

An \textit{edge-weighted graph} is a graph $(V,E)$ paired with an
edge-weighting function $\omega \colon E \to \rr$.

Two graphs $(V,E)$ and $(V',E')$ are called \textit{isomorphic} if there
exists a bijection $\phi \colon V \to V'$ such that $\{v,v'\} \in E$ if and
only if $\{\phi(v),\phi(v')\} \in E'$.  So, in other words, adjacency of
vertices is preserved.

A graph $(V',E')$ is a \textit{subgraph} of a graph $(V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq
V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.

\subsubsection{Trees}
\label{sec:trees}

A \textit{tree} is a connected graph with no cycles.  A tree can also be
characterised in other ways, some of which are given in the following theorem
(see \citep[][section 2.3.4.1]{knuth97taocp1} for a proof):

\begin{thm}
  If $G$ is a graph with exactly $n$ vertices, the following statements are
  equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item $G$ is a tree,
  \item $G$ is connected, but if any edge is deleted the resulting graph is no
    longer connected,
  \item There is exactly one path between any two distinct vertices of $G$,
  \item $G$ contains no cycles and has $n-1$ edges,
  \item $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

A \textit{forest} is a disjoint union of trees or, equivalently, a graph with
no cycles.  A \textit{rooted tree} is a tree with one distinguished vertex
called the root which we usually denote by $\rho$.  A vertex in a tree is
called a \textit{leaf} if it has degree 1.  Figure~\ref{tree-examples}
illustrates these definitions.

Suppose $X$ is a finite, nonempty set, a \textit{phylogenetic $X$-tree} is a
tree with no degree 2 vertices and set of leaves $X$.  A \textit{rooted
  phylogenetic $X$-tree} (henceforth $X$-tree for short) is a rooted tree with
no degree 2 vertices except possibly the root and with leaf set $X$.

For an edge-weighted tree
$T$ we call an edge-weighting \textit{proper} if $w(e) > 0$ for every interior
edge $e$ of $T$.

A rooted tree has a natural partial order on the vertices.  Given a tree
$T=(V,E)$, a vertex $v \in E$ is an \textit{ancestor} of a vertex $v' \in E$
if and only if $v$ is on the path from $v'$ to the root.  The vertex $v'$ is
then said to be a \textit{descendant} of $v$.  If $v$ and $v'$ are adjacent
then we also call $v$ the \textit{parent} of $v'$ and $v'$ a \textit{child} of
$v$.  The number of children of a particular vertex is also its out degree.

We call two $X$-trees $T,T'$ \textit{equivalent} (written $T \simeq T'$) if
there exists a bijection $\phi \colon V(T) \to V(T')$ which preserves
adjacency, is the identity on $X$ and maps the root of one tree to the root of
the other.  This means that, in addition to adjacency, the parent and child
relationships are preserved.  Figure~\ref{graph-isomorphism} illustrates these
concepts using trees.

The \textit{lowest common ancestor} of two vertices $v$ and $v'$ in a rooted
tree is the unique vertex that lies on the pat from $v$ to $v'$, the path from
$v$ to the root and the path from $v'$ to the root.  The lowest common
ancestor of $v$ and $v'$ is denoted $\lca(v,v')$.

A tree in which all vertices have degree 3 is called \textit{binary}.  Rooted
binary trees are often defined with the root having degree 2; we define a
\textit{rooted binary $X$-tree} to be an $X$-tree where each vertex has out
degree 2 and in degree 1 apart from the root which has in degree 0.

A connected subgraph of a tree is called a \textit{subtree}.  If $T$ is an
$X$-tree and $X' \subseteq X$ then we denote by $T|X'$ the minimal subtree of
$X$ whose vertex set contains $X'$, with degree 2 vertices suppressed.  $T|X'$
is then called a \textit{restricted subtree}.  If $T$ is binary and $|X'| = 3$
then $T|X'$ is a triplet.

\subsubsection{Distances}
\label{sec:distances}

Given an edge-weighted (unrooted) pyhlogenetic $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ where
$T=(V,E)$ and $\omega \colon E \to \rr$ we can associate a distance
$D_{(T,\omega)} \colon X \times X \to \rr$ to $(T,\omega)$ by setting for all
$x,y \in X$:
\begin{equation*}
  D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle
    \sum_{e \in P(x,y)} \omega(e) & \text{if $x \neq y$},\\
    0 & \text{otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $P(x,y)$ is the set of edges on the path from $x$ to $y$.  We call
$D_{(T,\omega)}$ the distance \textit{induced} by $(T,\omega)$.  A distance
$\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ is called a \textit{tree metric} if there
exists a phylogenetic tree $T=(V,E)$ with edge-weighting $\omega \colon E \to
\rr$ such that $\delta(x,y) = D_{(T,\omega)}$ for all $x,y \in X$.  So for any
edge-weighted phylogenetic $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$, the distance
$D_{(T,\omega)}$ is a tree metric.

The \textit{four-point condition} allows us to decide whether a given metric
is in fact a tree metric.  A distance $\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$
satisfies the four-point condition if for every $w,x,y,z \in X$ the following
holds:
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(w,x) + \delta(y,z) \leq \max(\delta(w,y)+\delta(x,z),
                                      \delta(w,z)+\delta(x,y)).
\end{equation*}
Since$w,x,y,z$ need not be distinct it is easy to see that if $\delta$
satisfies the four-point condition then it satisfies the triangle inequality
and is therefore a metric.  Further, $\delta$ is a tree metric on $X$ if and
only if it satisfies the four-point condition \citep{semple2003phylogenetics}.
This can be seen in the quartet tree shown in figure~\ref{fig:quartet}.

An important property of tree metrics is that for any tree metric $\delta
\colon X \times X \to \rr$ there is, up to isomorphism, a unique edge-weighted
$X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ for which $\delta(x,y) = D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y)$ for all
$x,y \in X$.  This tree can be recovered from the metric in polynomial time
\citep{semple2003phylogenetics}.

A distance $\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ is called an
\textit{ultrametric} if for every distinct $x,y,z \in X$ the following holds:
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(x,y) \leq \max(\delta(x,z),\delta(y,z)).
\end{equation*}
Any ultrametric satisfies the four-point condition and is therefore also a
tree metric.

An edge-weighting $\omega \colon E \to \rr$ for a rooted $X$-tree $T=(V,E)$ is
called \textit{equidistant} if it satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $D_{(T,\omega)}(\rho,x) = D_{(T,\omega)}(\rho,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$,
\item[(ii)] $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) \geq D_{(T,\omega)}(x,v)$ for all $x \in X$
  and any $u,v \in V$ whenever $v$ is encountered first on the path from $x$
  to $\rho$.
\end{itemize}
If $\omega$ is an equidistant edge-weighting then $D_{(T,w)}$ is an
ultrametric \citep{semple2003phylogenetics}.  Rooted $X$-trees with
equidistant edge-weightings arise naturally in many places, for example in
phylogenetics.

For any ultrametric $\delta \colon X \times X \to \rr$ there is, up to
isomorphism, a unique rooted $X$-tree $T$ with equidistant edge-weighting
$\omega$ such that $\delta(x,y) = D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$.
As with a general tree metric, this tree can be recovered from the ultrametric
in polynomial time.

\section{Tree construction}
\label{sec:tree-construction}

In this section we look at various methods of constructing trees.  Of most
interest to us is the problem of constructing an $X$-tree from a dissimilarity
on $X$.  This is generally done by one of two broad classes of hierarchical
clustering methods which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:hier-clust-meth}.

A further problem is that of constructing an edge-weighted $X$-tree from a
dissimilarity on $X$.

This is desirable in many cases, for example in
phylogenetics the edge-weights might represent the time 

Given a
dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr_{\geq 0}$ and a weighted $X$-tree
$(T,\omega)$ produced by some construction method, we call that method
\textit{consistent} if it satisfies the property that whenever $d$ is a tree
metric on $X$ then $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$.  In
other words, if given a tree metric the construction method produced the
unique tree identified by the tree metric.

The next problem is constructing trees from only partial distance information.
This means that we do not have the dissimilarity $d$, but rather only have the
values $d(x,y)$ for some, but not all, pairs $x,y in X$.  This problem is
motivated by the fact that accurate distance measurements are often difficult
or impossible to obtain in practice but one would still like to build a tree
given only what is known.

As with complete distance information, it is possible for partial distance
information to uniquely determine a tree.  This is the subject of
Section~\ref{sec:lassoing-corralling}.  This means that we can essentially
speak of consistency with regards to partial distance construction methods.
Such methods are the subject of Chapter~\ref{cha:lasso-construction}.

\subsection{Construction from subtrees}
\label{sec:constr-from-subtr}

Before we look at constructing trees from distances, it is interesting to note
that we do not actually need a distance to construct only the topology of a
rooted $X$-tree.  It suffices merely to know the set of \textit{triplets}
displayed by the tree.

A pair of leaves of a rooted $X$-tree that share the same parent is called a
\textit{cherry}.  A rooted $X$-tree with $|X| = 3$ that contains a cherry is
called a \textit{triplet}.  If $X = \{a,b,c\}$ and $a,b$ is a cherry then we
denote the triplet by $ab|c$.  We say that a triplet $ab|c$ is
\textit{displayed} by a tree $T$ if $T|{a,b,c}$ is binary and $lca_T(a,c) =
lca_T(b,c)$ is an ancestor of $lca_T(a,b)$ in $T$.

The \textsc{Build} algorithm can reconstruct a tree from the set of all
triplets displayed by it.  Let $T$ be an $X$-tree and $R$ be a set of trees
$\{T|X_1,dotsc,T|X_n\}$ where $X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n = X$.  The
\textsc{Build} algorithm uses an auxiliary graph $[R,S]$, where $S \subset X$
which has vertex set $S$ and an edge $\{a,b\}$ for each $a,b \in S$ whenever
there exists a $c \in S$ and a $T' \in R$ such that $T'|\{a,b,c\} = ab|c$ (a
triplet).

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{\textsc{Build} algorithm.}
  \label{alg:build}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set of rooted trees $R = \{T|X_1,\dotsc,T|X_n\}$.
    \Ensure  An $X$-tree $T$ where $X = X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n$.

    \State $S = \{x_1,\dotsc,x_m\} \gets X_1 \cup \dotsb \cup X_n$.

    \If{$|S| = 1$} \Return the tree $(\{x_1\},\emptyset)$. \EndIf

    \If{$|S| = 2$} let $\rho$ be a new vertex and \Return the tree with root
    node $\rho$ obtained by attaching $x_1$ and $x_2$ to $\rho$. \EndIf

    \State Construct the graph $[R,S]$.

    \State Let $S_1,\dotsc,S_k$ be the vertex sets of the connected components
    of $[R,S]$.

    \ForAll{$1 \leq i \leq k$}
    \State Let $T_i$ be the output of \textsc{Build} on $R_i$ where $R_i =
    \{T|S_i \colon T \in R\}$.
    \EndFor

    \State Let $\rho$ be a new vertex and \Return the tree with root node
    $\rho$ obtained by attaching the root of each $T_i$ to $\rho$.
    
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Construction from distances}
\label{sec:constr-from-dist}

Hierarchical clustering methods build rooted trees which are generally binary
and without edge-weightings.  UPGMA is similar but adds edge-weightings.
Using Buneman indices and building from splits gives edge-weightings.
Neighbour-joining, constructs an edge-weighted binary tree.

Some, but not all, of the methods have the property that if the distance is a
tree metric or ultrametric, the tree constructed will be the unique tree for
that metric.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical clustering methods}
\label{sec:hier-clust-meth}

Hierarchical clustering is used for the classification of information in much
the same way as partitional clustering.  The aim is to produce a rooted
$X$-tree corresponding to a dataset $X$ and dissimilarity on $X$.  While a
partition of a dataset is merely a set of subsets which cover the dataset, an
$X$-tree can be viewed as a hierarchy of such clusters which induces several
partitions on $X$.  This natural relationship between trees and partitions is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tree-partitions}.

There are two main methods in use for building hierarchies, these are the
agglomerative or bottom-up method which begins with each element of the
dataset in its own cluster and successively merges clusters until there is
only one, and the divisive or top-down method which begins with a single
cluster and successively splits clusters until each element is on its own.
The resulting hierarchy depends upon which merges or splits have been chosen
at each stage, and this depends on finding a local optimum according to some
criterion.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.}
  \label{alg:agglomerative}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$, and a
    linkage function $D \colon 2^X \times 2^X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A rooted $X$-tree $T$.

    \State Let $F$ be a forest of $|X|$ trees each containing a unique element
    of $X$ as the only vertex, which is also the root.

    \While{$|F| > 1$}

       \State Let $v$ be a new vertex and $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmin_{x,y
         \in F} D(L(x),L(y))$.
       \State Remove trees $x$ and $y$ from $F$ and add the tree obtained by
         attaching the roots of $x$ and $y$ to $v$ and letting $v$ be the root.
    
    \EndWhile

    \State \Return the single tree contained in $F$.
    
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The general algorithm for agglomerative clustering is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:agglomerative}.  The choice of linkage function determines
which trees are joined at each stage.  Given a set $X$ and dissimilarity $d
\colon X \times X \to \rr$, some common choices for linkage functions include
single-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:slink}
  D_{SL}(X,Y) = \min_{x \in X, y \in Y} d(x,y),
\end{equation}
complete-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:clink}
  D_{CL}(X,Y) = \max_{x \in X, y \in Y} d(x,y),
\end{equation}
and average-linkage:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:alink}
  D_{AL}(X,Y) = \left( \sum_{x \in X} \sum_{y \in Y} d(x,y) \right) / |X| |Y|.
\end{equation}

The general algorithm for agglomerative clustering has runtime complexity of
$O(n^3)$ where $n = |X|$ since there are $O(n)$ merges to be done and finding
the $\argmin$ takes $O(n^2)$ time.  However, for all three of the linkage
functions above there are special algorithms which run in only $O(n^2)$ time,
these are SLINK \citep{sibson1973slink}, CLINK \citep{defays1977efficient} and
UPGMA \citep{sokal1958statistical}.

The divisive algorithm is very similar but it requires a more complicated
decision about how to split a cluster.  A divisive algorithm may also
terminate before $|X|$ clusters have been obtained in which case the order in
which the clusters are split becomes important.  A naÃ¯ve approach is to always
split the largest cluster first, but there are more complicated approaches
based instead on cluster homogeneity.  Once it has been decided to split a
cluster, a partitional clustering algorithm can be used to perform the split
\citep{ding2002cluster}.

\subsubsection{UPGMA}
\label{sec:upgma}

The UPGMA algorithm is in fact a modified agglomerative clustering algorithm
using average-linkage which constructs an edge-weighted rooted $X$-tree.  The
edge-weighting constructed by UPGMA is always equidistant.  For any
equidistant $X$-tree $T$, let $\height(T)$ be the length of the path from the
root to any leaf, or 0 if the root is the sole vertex.  The algorithm for
UPGMA is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:upgma}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{UPGMA algorithm.}
  \label{alg:upgma}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, and a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A rooted $X$-tree $T$ and equidistant edge-weighting $\omega$.

    \State Let $F$ be a forest of $|X|$ trees each containing a unique element
    of $X$ as the only vertex, which is also the root.

    \While{$|F| > 1$}

       \State Let $v$ be a new vertex, $\displaystyle m \gets \min_{x,y
         \in F} D_{AL}(L(x),L(y))$, and $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmin_{x,y
         \in F} D_{AL}(L(x),L(y))$.
       \State Remove trees $x$ and $y$ from $F$ and add the tree obtained by
         attaching the root of $x$ to $v$ with an edge of length $m/2 -
         \height(x)$, attaching the root of $y$ to $v$ with an edge of length
         $m/2 - \height(y)$ and letting $v$ be the root.
    
    \EndWhile

    \State \Return the single tree contained in $F$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Since only two trees are joined at once, the output of UPGMA is always a
binary tree.  If $d$ is an ultrametric and identifies a binary tree, then the
output of UPGMA is equivalent to this tree.

\subsubsection{Neighbour joining}
\label{sec:neighbour-joining}

Neighbour joining is a method for building an edge-weighted unrooted $X$-tree
which, like UPGMA, is consistent if the dissimilarity identifies a binary
tree but, unlike UPGMA, the consistency holds for general tree metrics.  The
algorithm works by replacing a cherry by a single vertex and recursively
applying neighbour joining to the resulting tree.  Neighbour joining is shown
in Algorithm~\ref{alg:neighbour-joining}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Neighbour joining algorithm.}
  \label{alg:neighbour-joining}

  \begin{algorithmic}
    \Require A set $X$, and a dissimilarity $d \colon X \times X \to \rr$.
    \Ensure  A rooted $X$-tree $T$ and equidistant edge-weighting $\omega$.

    \If{$|X| = 2$} Let $X = \{x,y\}$ and \Return the tree obtained by joining
    $x$ and $y$ with an edge of length $d(x,y)$.
    \EndIf

    \State $\displaystyle (x,y) \gets \argmax_{x,y \in X} d(x,y) + \frac{1}{2}
    \sum_{r \in X - \{x,y\}} (d(r,x)+d(r,y)-d(x,y))$.

    \State $X' \gets X - \{x,y\} \cup \{v\}$ where $v \notin X$.

    \State Define a dissimilarity $d' \colon X' \times X' \to \rr$ by:
    \begin{equation*}
      d'(p,q) =
      \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if $p,q \notin X$} \\
        (d(x,p)+d(y,p)-d(x,y))/2 & \text{if $p \in X, q \notin X$} \\
        (d(x,q)+d(y,q)-d(x,y))/2 & \text{if $p \notin X, q \in X$} \\
        d(p,q) & \text{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    \State Let $T'$ be the tree obtained by applying Neighbour joining to $X'$
    and $d'$.

    \State Attach $x$ and $y$ to the leaf vertex $v$ of $T'$.

    \State Put $\displaystyle \omega(\{v,x\}) \gets \frac{1}{2} d(x,y) +
    \frac{1}{2(|X|-2)} \sum_{u \in X} (d(u,x)-d(u,y))$.

    \State Put $\omega(\{v,y\}) \gets d(x,y) - \omega(\{v,x\})$.

    \State \Return $(T,\omega)$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Construction from partial dissimilarities}
\label{sec:constr-from-part}

A partial dissimilarity is one defined for only a subset of all pairs of
elements.  Let $M \subseteq \dset^2$ be the set of all pairs of elements for
which we do not know the dissimilarity.  We have only a function $d^* \colon
\dset^2 - M \to \rr$ or a $|\dset|^2$ dissimilarity matrix in which there are
``holes'' or pairs labelled as ``unknown''.

Partial dissimilarities arise often in practice.  It is sometimes difficult or
impossible to make measurements between certain pairs and sometimes complete
information may not be given by test subjects.

For this reason it becomes useful to ask whether such a partial dissimilarity
can be extended into a complete dissimilarity that is also a tree metric or
ultrametric.  We would like to find some $d \colon \dset^2 \to \rr$ for which
$d(x,y) = d^*(x,y)$ for all $(x,y) \in \dset^2 - M$ and which is a tree metric
or ultrametric.  In \citep{farach1995robust} it was shown that the problem of
deciding whether such an extension to a tree metric exists is NP-complete but
the special case of an extension to an ultrametric is in P.

Below we describe three different methods given in the literature for
extending a partial dissimilarity to an ultrametric.  There are also many
methods that have been devised for the more general problem of extension to a
tree metric which we do not review but can be found in, for example,
\citep{guenoche1999approximations}, \citep{farach1995robust},
\citep{makarenkov2001nouvelle} and \citep{guenoche2004extension}.

\subsubsection{An optimisation method}
\label{sec:part-dist-optim-method}

The approach taken by \citet{de1984ultrametric} is to consider a least squares
constrained optimisation problem.  Given a partial dissimilarity $d^* \colon
\dset^2 - M \to \rr$ we wish to find a function $d \colon \dset^2 \to \rr$
such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:partial-dist-least-squares}
  L(d) = \sum_{(x,y) \in \dset^2 - M} (d^*(x,y)-d(x,y))^2
\end{equation}
is minimised and $d$ is an ultrametric.  The method used is a sequential
unconstrained minimisation technique.  The constraint that $d$ must be an
ultrametric is removed and instead we find a dissimilarity $d_n$ which minimises
the augmented function:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:partial-dist-optimisation}
  \Phi(d_n,\sigma) = L(d_n) + \sigma P(d_n), \qquad (\sigma > 0).
\end{equation}
The function $L$ is called the \textit{loss function} and $P$ is the
\textit{penalty function} which is meant to enforce the ultrametric
condition.  $P$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:penalty-function}
  P(d_n) = \sum_{(i,j,k) \in \Omega(d_n)} (d_n(i,k) - d_n(j,k))^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \Omega(d_n) = \{(i,j,k) \in \dset^3 \colon d(i,j) \leq \min(d_n(i,k),d_n(j,k))
  \text{ and } d_n(i,k) \neq d_n(j,k)\},
\end{equation*}
or, in other words, the set of triples for which the ultrametric condition is
violated.  The unconstrained minimisation is performed successively with an
increasing value for $\sigma$, each time using the previous result $d_{n-1}$
to begin the search for the next $d_n$.  To perform the unconstrained
minimisation of the augmented function, a method by \citet{powell1977restart}
is used.

\subsubsection{An agglomerative method}
\label{sec:part-dist-agglom-method}

The method used by \citet{schader1992mvl}, which they call Missing Values
Linkage (MVL), is actually identical to the agglomerative algorithm shown in
Section~\ref{sec:hier-clust-meth} but using a linkage criterion modified to
take into account missing values.  For example, the modified average-linkage
criterion is:
\begin{equation*}
  D_{MVL}(X,Y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle
    \frac{(\sum_{(x,y) \in X \times Y - M} d(x,y)}{|X \times Y - M|} & \text{if $X
      \times Y - M \neq \emptyset$,} \\
    \infty & \text{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $M = \{(i,j) \in \dset^2 \colon d(i,j) \text{ is unknown}\}$.

The authors do not provide an algorithm with better time complexity than that
of the naÃ¯ve agglomerative algorithm ($O(n^3)$).  They show that the MVL
method produces very similar results to \citeauthor{de1984ultrametric}'s
method.

\subsubsection{A divisive method}
\label{sec:part-dist-divisive-method}

\citet{farach1995robust} use a top down, divisive approach.  Let $G=(V,E)$ be
a graph with vertex set $\dset$ and an edge $\{x,y\}$ with $x,y \in \dset$
whenever $x \neq y$ and $d(x,y)$ is known.  We also define an edge-weighting
$\omega \colon E \to \rr$ by $\omega(\{x,y\}) = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in E$.

The tree construction algorithm proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $E = \emptyset$, return the single element in $V$.
\item Otherwise, put $m \gets max_{e \in E} \omega(e)$.
\item Let $G* = (V,E^*)$ be a graph and put $E^* \gets \{e \in E \colon
  \omega(e) < m\}$.
\item Let $u$ be a new vertex and return the tree with root node $u$ obtained
  by recursing on each connected component of $G^*$ and attaching the results
  of each to $u$.
\end{enumerate}
This basic algorithm requires $O(|V||E|)$ time but a quicker algorithm
requiring only $O(|E| + |V|\log |V|)$ is described also.

\section{Lassos}
\label{sec:lassoing-corralling}

All of the methods for constructing a tree from a partial dissimilarity listed
in Section~\ref{sec:constr-from-part} have one thing in common: the tree
produced in undefined when more than one extension to an ultrametric is
possible.

Certain partial distances have the property that they uniquely determine the
topology or edge-weights of one tree or, in other words, only one extension to
an ultrametric is possible.  To enable us to understand when partial
dissimilarities have this uniqueness property, the theory of lassos was
developed.

\subsection{Definitions and basic properties}
\label{sec:defin-basic-prop}

Let $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$ be some subset of the pairwise distances
over $X$ and $(T,\omega), (T',\omega')$ be two edge-weighted $X$-trees.  These
two trees are called \textit{$\cL$-isometric} if $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) =
D_{(T',\omega')}(x,y)$ for all $xy \in \cL$.

Now, given an $X$-tree $T$ and a subset $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$ we
define $\cL$ to be:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item an \textit{edge-weight lasso} if $\omega = \omega'$ holds for all proper
  edge-weightings $\omega,\omega'$ of $T$ where $(T,\omega),(T,\omega')$ are
  $\cL$-isometric,
\item a \textit{topological lasso} if $T \simeq T'$ holds for any $X$-tree
  $T'$ for which there exist proper edge-weightings $\omega,\omega'$ of $T,T'$
  respectively where $(T,\omega),(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$-isometric,
\item a \textit{strong lasso} if $(T,\omega) \equiv (T',\omega')$ holds for
  every given proper edge-weighting $\omega$ and any edge-weighted $X$-tree
  $(T',\omega')$ where $(T,\omega),(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$-isometric.
\end{enumerate}

For further information and discussion about lassos, especially those
concerning general $X$-trees, the reader is referred to \citep{DHS11}.

\subsection{Lassoing rooted $X$-trees}
\label{sec:lassoing-rooted-x}

Lassos for rooted $X$-trees can be characterised using a graph associated to
each interior vertex of a tree \citep{HP13}.  Given an $X$-tree $T$, some $v
\in \iV(T)$, and a set of cords $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$, we associate a
graph called $G(\cL,v)$.  The vertex set of the graph $V_V$ is the set of all
child edges of $v$.  The edge set is the set of all $\{e,e'\} \subseteq {V_v
  \choose 2}$ for which there exist leaves $a,b \in X$ and a cord $ab \in \cL$
such that $e$ and $e'$ are edges on the path from $a$ to $b$ in $T$.  We call
the graph $G(\cL,v)$ the \textit{child-edge graph} (\textit{of $v$ with
  respect to $T$ and $\cL$}.

We have the following important result due to \cite{HP13}:
\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:child-edge-graph-complete}
  Suppose $T$ is an $X$-tree and $\cL \subseteq {X \choose 2}$ is a covering
  of $X$.  Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\cL$ is a topological lasso for $T$,
  \item for every vertex $v \in \iV(T)$, the graph $G(\cL,v)$ is complete.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

Due to the characterisation of edge-weight lassos also presented in the paper,
we have the following corollary:
\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:topo-is-edge-weight}
  Suppose that $T$ is an $X$-tree.  Then every topological lasso for $T$ must
  also be an edge-weight lasso, and therefore a strong lasso, for $T$.
\end{cor}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{figures/dist-min-lass/lasso-example.pdft}
\end{center}
\caption{For $X = \{a,\dotsc,e\}$ and $\cL=\{ac,de,bc,ce,cd\}$ the trees $T$
  and $T'$, depicted in (i) and (ii) respectively, induce the same distances
  over the cords in $\cL$ despite having different topologies.  In this case
  $\cL$ is not a topological lasso.}
\label{fig:lasso-example}
\end{figure}

To illustrate some of these concepts consider the two trees in
Figure~\ref{fig:lasso-example}.  The edge-weights on the edges are
proportional to the length of the edges as shown.  The trees are therefore
equidistant.  For convenience we denote a cord $\{a,b\}$ simply as $ab$.  If
we have the set of cords $\cL=\{ac,de,bc,ce,cd\}$ then notice that the
distances between each of these pairs of leaves is the same for both trees.
Therefore $\cL$ is not a topological lasso.  Notice that this property of
$\cL$ is dependant solely on the structure of the set itself and not on the
actual distances on the trees.
