\label{cha:contributions}

This chapter contains a brief outline of the original contributions made by
the candidate to date.
\begin{itemize}
\item Showed that minimisation of the centroid-distance ($k$-means)
  homogeneity criterion is not equivalent to maximisation of the separation
  criterion when a mixed-data metric is used,
\item Proved that \textsc{All-Squares Clustering} is NP-complete with a
  3-valued metric by transformation from the \textsc{Partition into Triangles}
  problem,
\item Proved that \textsc{All-Squares Clustering} is NP-complete with a
  $p$-valued metric whenever $p\geq 3$,
\item Proved that \textsc{Centroid-Distance Clustering} is NP-complete with a
  3-valued metric by transformation from the \textsc{Dominating Set} problem,
\item Proved that \textsc{Centroid-Distance Clustering} is NP-complete with a
  $p$-valued metric whenever $p\geq 3$,
\item Extended the Assignment Metric to allow comparing nonempty subsets of a
  metric space of arbitrary size.  The assignment metric can now be used to
  compare partitions while taking into account the underlying metric space of
  the data, which is a major improvement on current methods for comparison,
\item Developed an algorithm for constructing a binary ultrametric tree from a
  strong lasso, similar to the \textsc{Build} algorithm,
\item Implemented the algorithm for testing purposes.
