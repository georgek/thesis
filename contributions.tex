This chapter contains a brief outline of the original contributions made by
the candidate to date.
\begin{itemize}
\item Showed that minimisation of the centroid-distance ($k$-means)
  homogeneity criterion is not equivalent to maximisation of the separation
  criterion when a mixed-data metric is used.  This means that the commonly
  used centroid-distance criterion should not generally be considered a
  criterion for the separation of clusters,
\item Proved that the \textsc{All-Squares Clustering} problem is NP-complete
  with a 3-valued metric by transformation from the \textsc{Partition into
    Triangles} problem, then proved that it is NP-complete with a $p$-valued
  metric whenever $p\geq 3$,
\item Proved that the \textsc{Centroid-Distance Clustering} problem is
  NP-complete with a 3-valued metric by transformation from the
  \textsc{Dominating Set} problem, then proved that it is NP-complete with a
  $p$-valued metric whenever $p\geq 3$,
\item Developed the Assignment Metric for comparing nonempty subsets of a
  metric space of arbitrary size.  The assignment metric can be used to
  compare partitions while taking into account the underlying metric space of
  the data, which is a major improvement on current methods for comparison of
  partitions,
\item Implemented the Assignment Metric for testing and comparison with other
  existing metrics,
\item Proved that a particular type of cover for a tree is a strong lasso,
\item Developed an algorithm for constructing a tree from a strong lasso,
  similar to the \textsc{Build} algorithm,
\item Implemented a simple framework for working with trees and the strong
  lasso construction algorithm for testing purposes.
