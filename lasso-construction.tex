\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Summary}

The wealth of phylogenetic information accumulated over many decades of
biological research, coupled with technological advances in molecular sequence
generation, bring realising the dream of reconstructing the Tree of Life
within our grasp. However, to make best use of this data wealth, numerous
problems must first be overcome. One key problem is finding powerful ways to
combine disparate datasets, a major part of which boils down to finding
effective strategies for dealing with missing data. In the form of the freely
available, novel \textsc{Lasso} approach we complement the currently available
toolkit of phylogenetic methods in order to solve this problem, in the case of
datasets consisting of partial distances.  This solution is made possible by
the ability of \textsc{Lasso} to discover, contrary to other phylogenetic
methods, a unique, edge-weighted tree that represents datasets of this type.
Furthermore, being distance-based, \textsc{Lasso} is very fast to run and thus is
suitable for datasets of all sizes, including large datasets such as those
generated by modern Next Generation Sequencing technologies. To better
understand the performance of \textsc{Lasso}, we assessed it by means of
artificial and real biological datasets, showing its effectiveness in the
presence of missing data both as a tree reconstruction approach and as a
supertree method.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:lasso-motivation}

The ease and speed with which molecular sequence data can now be generated
using modern Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled
evolutionary biologists to embark on exciting, albeit highly challenging,
endeavours such as the Tree of Life project. NGS has perhaps been most
influential at the sub-species level, and datasets encompassing numerous
lines, strains or accessions are becoming commonplace. These new data,
together with a wealth of legacy datasets, promise the interleaving of species
and sub-species within a common evolutionary framework.  However, to increase
our chances of successfully constructing such a tree numerous obstacles have
to be overcome, ranging from data collection via data storage and information
extraction to tree building. The vastness of tree space one faces in
overcoming the latter obstacle, that of tree building, coupled with the
computational demands of Bayesian, likelihood and parsimony approaches implies
that reconstruction methods based on these approaches cannot, at least at
present, be directly applied to obtain such a tree. Given the large amount of
legacy phylogenetic data, a natural solution is to try to find ways to merge
what is already known and then to augment the result. Apart from having to
deal with the problem of patchy taxonomic coverage, as some taxa have been
studied more than others (see, for example,
\cite{sanderson10phylogenomics,philippe2004phylogenomics,steel10characterizing,roure12impact}
for more on this), constructing such a tree does not only entail finding ways
to combine different types, qualities, and quantities of data but also
addresses the problem of how to combine data sets that might only share very
few taxa. The latter is a formidable problem in its own right and boils down
to finding powerful ways of dealing with missing information.

Depending on the study within which a dataset was generated missing
information may take the form of trees that have few taxa in common, or
missing values in character state or distance matrices.  To tackle the former,
numerous supertree approaches have been introduced in the literature (see, for
example, \cite{bininda04phylogenetic} and \cite{brinkmeyer13flipcut} and the
references therein).  A similar number of supermatrix approaches have also
been proposed to deal with missing values in character state matrices (see,
for example, \cite{bininda04phylogenetic}) while the number of approaches
addressing missing values in distance matrices is comparatively small (see
\cite{criscuolo2006sdm,criscuolo2008fastnj,makarenkov2001nouvelle,guenoche1999approximations,guenoche2004extension,de1984ultrametric,gaul1994pyramidal}).

The starting point for many supertree approaches is a collection of
(potentially very small) phylogenetic trees and the goal is to find some kind
of parental tree on all the taxa of the input trees that in some sense
displays the evolutionary information contained within them.  In contrast, the
starting point for the remaining two approaches are character state matrices
and distances on differing taxa sets, respectively. The aim here is to combine
them into a supermatrix or distance, respectively, on all the taxa in the
combined taxa set using some sort of imputing scheme (see
e.\,g\,\cite{bininda04phylogenetic} and \cite{queiroz06supermatrix} for such
schemes in the supermatrix context and
\cite{guenoche1999approximations,makarenkov2001nouvelle,guenoche2004extension}
in the distance context).  From the obtained matrices a phylogenetic tree is
then constructed using one of the many tree reconstruction techniques.

All three types of approach have their pros and cons, with supermatrices being
criticised on, for example, the dependence of the generated supermatrix upon
the order in which the missing values are inferred, and the potentially heavy
influence of even a small error in the estimation of a missing value on the
tree topology, the latter due to a cascading effect such an error might have
on other inferred missing values \cite{lapointe04everything}.  Criticisms of
supertrees include not using primary information, combining trees that have
potentially evolved under different evolutionary models into a supertree
without properly accounting for this, and not properly taking branch-lengths
associated with the input trees into account (see \cite{willson04constructing}
for an exception to this and \cite{kupczok11consequences} for a recent
comparison of supertree methods).  Finally, criticisms of distances include
losing valuable phylogenetic information between, for example, two DNA
sequences by representing the observed difference by a single number.
Nonetheless, distance-based tree reconstruction methods are known to provide
quick but rough snapshots of the evolutionary relationships contained within a
dataset making them particularly attractive for large datasets. In addition to
providing evolutionary insights in their own right their attraction also lies
in the provision of a potentially good starting/guide tree for more
sophisticated, but computationally intensive, methods such as Maximum
Likelihood and Bayesian Inference.

For popular distance methods such as Neighbor Joining \cite{saitou1987nj}, and
BioNJ \cite{gascuel97bionj} (in the unrooted case) and \textsc{UPGMA}
\cite{sokal1958statistical} (in the rooted case) to be applicable, however,
the distance on the combined taxa set $X$ must be {\em complete}, that is, a
distance value must be available for any two taxa in $X$, which is not always
guaranteed. On the other hand, simulation studies (see
e.g. \cite{criscuolo2006sdm}) indicate that distance datasets can contain a
considerable amount of redundancy, suggesting that not all distances are
required to reconstruct the underlying tree. To better understand this
redundancy from a uniqueness, rather than a reconstructability, point of view
as the aforementioned approaches do, recent work in \cite{dress11lassoing}
focused on the following fundamental question: Given an edge-weighted
phylogenetic tree on some taxa set, between which pairs of taxa does a
distance value have to be available so that those pairs of taxa uniquely
determine that tree (where availability is meant as presence or absence of a
distance value and does not take into account the actual distance values
themselves)? Formalised in terms of when a set of pairs of taxa lassos a
phylogenetic tree, it turns out that this question is surprisingly difficult
to answer when the tree in question is unrooted (see
\cite{dress11lassoing,huber2014tree} for recent partial theoretical results)
and not much is known about the rooted tree case.

As it turns out, the situation changes in the case where, in addition to being
rooted, the sought after tree is also {\em equidistant}, that is, the distance
from the root of the tree to each of its leaves is the same (see
\cite{huber13lassoing} for some mathematical characterisations).  Sometimes
referred to as equidistant representations \cite{semple2003phylogenetics} or
ultrametric trees such trees are commonly constructed when a molecular clock
can be assumed for the evolution of the taxa of interest.  Although molecular
clocks have been criticised strongly over the years (see
\cite{ayala99molecular,schwartz06molecular}), widely-used software packages
such as BEAST rely heavily on the concept \cite{bouckaert14beast}.
Intriguingly, this popularity may be linked in part to the recent emergence of
NGS datasets, including many consistent with a molecular clock, particularly
those at the sub-species level.  Indeed, examples of studies where the
molecular clock assumption has been satisfied include population studies where
they helped to understand the genetic diversity of germplasms
\cite{xiao10ssr}, palaeontological studies where they helped to estimate
divergence dates or shed light into effects that climate change and other
global factors might have had on diversification \cite{weir08ice}, and
phylogeographic studies \cite{confal1998mitochon} (see
\cite{weir08calibrating} for more on these examples and
\cite{hellmuth13orthology} where so called symbolic ultrametric trees were
used in orthology detection).

In the form of the \textsc{Lasso} approach, we propose a novel method for
(super)tree reconstruction from {\em partial distances}, that is, some of the
distance values between taxa are missing. Contrary to the methods alluded to
above, \textsc{Lasso} is not imputing-based and is similar in spirit to the
supermatrix approach introduced in \cite{misof13selecting} and the
veto-supertree approach proposed in \cite{scorn08physic} in that not every
taxon in the combined taxa set is guaranteed to be a leaf in the resulting
tree. It essentially works by trying to detect a treelike signal on as many
taxa as possible from the available distances and then reconstructs the
\textit{unique} equidistant tree on those taxa.  Like {\sc UPGMA}, \textsc{Lasso}
is also an iterative process in the sense that it begins with a partial (or
complete) distance $D$ on some taxa set $X$ with a graph $G$ of $|X|$ isolated
vertices, each of which is labelled by an element in $X$. In each repetition
step, the distance on a smaller taxa set is recomputed and, in a bottom up
manner, an equidistant tree on $X$ is reconstructed. In contrast to {\sc
  UPGMA}, \textsc{Lasso} looks to replace a certain type of edge-weighted clique
in a canonical graph theoretical representation of the given distances by a
composite vertex, rather than only an edge in that graph as {\sc UPGMA}
does. In addition, the distances between a newly created composite vertex and
any other vertices is calculated by some kind of consensus rather than merely
using average linkage as in the case of {\sc UPGMA}.  These two differences
ensure that \textsc{Lasso} enjoys several desirable properties such as {\em
  consistency} whereby we mean that the equidistant tree $T$ returned by {\sc
  Lasso} is the unique tree which, for any two taxa $x$ and $y$ in the leaf
set of $T$ for which $D(x,y)$ is known, is the distance between them in $T$.

We assessed the performance of \textsc{Lasso} as a tree reconstruction approach
from partial distances using simulated datasets and a real biological dataset
containing 26 intra-specific strains of the wild yeast \textit{Saccharomyces
  paradoxus} \cite{west14ribosomal}.  In both studies, and independent of the
shape of the topology of the starting equidistant tree, we found that even
with $10\%$ of the distances missing \textsc{Lasso} was able to successfully
reconstruct that tree, suggesting that it holds great promise for tree
reconstruction in the face of missing values.  In addition, to help illustrate
\textsc{Lasso}'s potential as a supertree approach we applied it to a wheat
accession dataset which we obtained by combining 411 wheat accessions
generated as part of the GEDIFLUX EU Framework V project \cite{gediflux} with
a dataset containing 118 accessions studied in \cite{muge}, approximately a
quarter of which are also included in the GEDIFLUX dataset. Finally, to enable
other researchers to apply \textsc{Lasso} to their own datasets, we implemented
the approach within software which, together with an accompanying manual, is
freely available for download from https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/lasso.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

To help detail the inner workings of \textsc{Lasso}, we first introduce some
relevant terminology and then present an outline of the \textsc{Lasso}
approach. For the convenience of the reader, we also present a worked example.
% in Section~\ref{sec:example}

\subsection{Basic terminology and assumptions}
\label{sec:terminology}

As before, we assume throughout this chapter that $X$ is a set containing at
least three taxa. Also, we refer to a rooted tree $T$ with no vertices
contained in precisely two edges (except possibly a distinguished vertex which
we call the {\em root} and denote by $\rho_T$) and whose leaf set is $X$ as a
{\em phylogenetic $X$-tree}, or {\em $X$-tree} for short.  In addition we say
that two $X$-trees $T$ and $T'$ are {\em equivalent} if they are isomorphic in
the usual graph theoretical sense and the underlying map is the identity on
$X$ that maps the root of $T$ to the root of $T'$.

Suppose for the following that $T$ is an $X$-tree.  An {\em edge weighting}
$\omega$ of $T$ is a map that assigns a non-negative real to every edge of $T$
such that $\omega(e)>0$ holds for every edge $e$ of $T$ that is not incident
with a leaf of $T$.  An {\em edge-weighted} $X$-tree is a pair $(T,\omega)$
where $T$ is an $X$-tree and $\omega$ is an edge-weighting for it.  We denote
the distance induced by an edge-weighted $X$-tree $(T,\omega)$ on its leaves
by $D_{(T,\omega)}$ and call the pair $(T,\omega)$ an {\em equidistant}
$X$-tree if ${\omega}$ is {\em equidistant}, that is
\begin{enumerate}
\item $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,\rho_T)=  D_{(T,\omega)}(y,\rho_T)$, for all elements
$x,y\in X$, and
\item $D_{(T,\omega)}(x,u)\geq D_{(T,\omega)}(x,v)$, for all elements $x\in X$
  and any vertices $u$ and $v$ of $T$ such that $u$ is encountered before $v$
  on the path from the root $\rho_T$ to $x$
\end{enumerate} 
holds (see also \cite{semple2003phylogenetics}). For convenience, we will sometimes refer to the
underlying $X$-tree of an equidistant $X$-tree as its {\em topology}.

Suppose $\cL$ is a {\em set of cords} on $X$, that is, a collection of subsets
of $X$ of size two. Then we call two equidistant $X$-trees $(T_1,\omega_1)$
and $(T_2,\omega_2)$ {\em $\cL$-isometric} if
$D_{(T_1,\omega_1)}(x,y)=D_{(T_2,\omega_2)}(x,y)$ holds for all cords $xy\in
\cL$ where we write $ab$ rather than $\{a,b\}$ for any set with two distinct
elements $a$ and $b$.  We say that $\cL$ is a {\em topological lasso} for $T$
if for every $X$-tree $T'$ and any equidistant edge-weightings $\omega$ of $T$
and $\omega'$ of $T'$, respectively, we have that $T$ and $T'$ are equivalent
whenever $(T,\omega)$ and $(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$-isometric (see
Fig.\ref{fig:block-graph-motivation} for an example).  Loosely speaking, a
topological lasso uniquely determines the topology of an equidistant
$X$-tree. If $\cL$ is a topological lasso for $T$ then we also say that $T$ is
{\em topologically lassoed} by $\cL$.  It follows from \cite{huber13lassoing}
that every topological lasso for $T$ is also a {\em strong lasso} for $T$,
that is, if $T'$ is a further $X$-tree and $\omega$ and $\omega'$ are
equidistant edge-weightings for $T$ and $T'$, respectively, such that
$(T,\omega)$ and $(T',\omega')$ are $\cL$--isometric then $T$ and $T'$ must be
equivalent and $\omega$ and $\omega'$ must coincide. Loosely speaking, strong
lassos do not only uniquely determine the topology of an equidistant $X$-tree
but also its edge-weighting.
 
For ease of readability, if the $X$-tree to which a topological lasso $\cL$
refers is of no relevance to the discussion, we will simply say that $\cL$ is
a topological lasso.  Similarly, we will say {\em equidistant tree} rather
than equidistant $X$-tree.

\subsection{The {\sc Lasso} algorithm}
\label{sec:sc-lasso-algorithm}

In this section, we present an outline of the \textsc{Lasso} algorithm.  The
algorithm is similar in spirit to \textsc{UPGMA} (as shown in
Section~\ref{sec:upgma}).  Like \textsc{UPGMA}, the \textsc{Lasso} approach is to
construct the tree from the bottom up in a repetitive fashion where each
repetition consists of a reduction step and a construction step.  However, and
contrary to {\sc UPGMA}, \textsc{Lasso} takes as input a partial distance on
$X$ (which can of course also be complete).  The complete algorithm outline is
shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:lasso}.  In the following sections we outline the
steps in detail.

\subsubsection{Method outline}
\label{sec:method-outline}

Given a partial distance $D$ on some taxa set $X$, \textsc{Lasso} aims to find a
subset $Y$ of taxa as large as possible so that the equidistant tree returned
by it is uniquely determined by the available distances on $Y$ with regards to
topology and edge-weighting.  In other words, \textsc{Lasso} finds an equidistant
$Y$-tree $(T,\omega) $ such that the set $\cL_Y$ comprising of all pairs in
$Y$ for which the distance under $D$ is known, is a strong lasso for $T$ and
$D_{(T,\omega)}(x,y) =D(x,y)$ holds for all cords $xy\in \cL_Y$.  To do this,
the set $\cL_D$ comprising all pairs of $X$ for which the distance under $D$
is known is first computed and then viewed as an edge-weighted graph
$\Gamma_D^{\omega}$, or $\Gamma^{\omega}$ for short. The (unweighted)
underlying graph $\Gamma(\cL_D)$ of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ has vertex set $X$ and
edge set $\cL_D$. The edge-weighting of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ associates to every
edge $xy$ of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ the distance $D(x,y)$.  Note that in the case
where $D$ is a complete distance on $X$, the graph $\Gamma(\cL_D)$ is
complete.  To preserve the given taxa set $X$, we put $X^r=X$.

For ease of presentation, assume from now on that we have already carried out
$q\geq 0$ repetitions and that $C$ is the selected {\em connected component}
of $\Gamma^{\omega}$, that is, one of the connected graphs that make up
$\Gamma^{\omega}$.  Note that for $q=0$ we may assume that $C$ is
$\Gamma^{\omega}$ itself as connectedness of the graph $\Gamma(\cL_D)$ and
thus of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ is a necessary condition for a $Z$-tree to be
topologically lassoed by a set of cords on some non-empty set $Z$
\cite{huber13lassoing}.  However it should be noted that $\Gamma^{\omega}$ may become
disconnected during successive repetitions.  In that case, we exploit the fact
that, as we will see below, in each repetition step an equidistant tree is
grown from (hopefully all) the vertices of a connected component of the graph
$\Gamma^{\omega}$ generated in the previous step. Put differently, we choose a
connected component of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ such that, over all connected
components of $\Gamma^{\omega}$, the leaf set of the tree grown from it is as
large as possible (where we break ties randomly). Other methods of component
choice are conceivable though, such as identifying that which possesses the
most cords of $\cL_D$.  Alternatively, it may be preferable to run \textsc{Lasso}
for each connected component of $\Gamma^{\omega}$ separately, in which case
prior biological knowledge might be used to join up the returned equidistant
trees.

Note that \textsc{Lasso} terminates if the selected connected component consists
of just one vertex.  Also note that to help mitigate against a poor choice of
a connected component which might yield an equidistant tree on a small number
of taxa of $X$, \textsc{Lasso} returns the tree that connects the most taxa in
$X$ (and its associated strong lasso) found over $p$ independent runs, where
$p$ is a user defined parameter that is currently set to ten.

To simplify the description of the remaining details of the $q$-th repetition
step, let $m$ denote the minimal edge weight over all edges of $C$. Then $C$
is transformed into an unweighted graph $C_m$ in which first all edges except
those with weight $m$ have been removed and then the weights of the remaining
edges are ignored. \textsc{Lasso} now chooses a connected component $S_m$ of
$C_m$ and a {\em suitable} clique of $S_m$ (see below for details) and grows
an equidistant tree using the vertex set of that clique. To make this more
precise define for any equidistant tree $(T',\omega')$ with leaf set $Z$ the
{\em height} of $T'$ to be $D_{(T',\omega')}(x,y)/2$ for any two elements $x$
and $y$ of $Z$ for which the path joining them crosses the root of $T'$.  Let
$G$ be a graph consisting of $|X|$ isolated vertices each of which is labelled
by an element in $X$. For the purpose of growing a tree it will be useful to
view each of them as an equidistant tree with height zero.

Now, let $K_m$ denote a suitable clique of $S_m$ found by \textsc{Lasso} (where
we break ties randomly).  Then to obtain a new distance $D_m$ on a smaller set
$X_m$ which, for example, ensures that \textsc{Lasso} terminates, we first remove
all vertices in $C$ from $X^r$ and then add a new vertex $u_m$ to obtain
$X_m$. Next, we define $D_m$ to be the distance on $X_m$ that assigns to any
$x$ and $y$ contained in $X_m$ the value $D(x,y)$ if $x$ and $y$ in
$X_m-\{u_m\}$, zero if $x=y=u_m$ and the value $D^*(x,y)$ if either $x=u_m$ or
$y=u_m$, where $D^*$ is a distance such as the one described below in the
section on recomputing the distance $D_m$.

To find the equidistant tree $(U_m,\omega_m) $ that \textsc{Lasso} grows from $X$
in this repetition step, let $l$ denote the size of the vertex set of $K_m$
and let $(T_1,\omega_1),\ldots, (T_l,\omega_l)$ denote the equidistant trees
with leaves in $X^r$ found in the previous repetition steps such that the
vertex set of $K_m$ comprises of the roots $\rho_i$ of $T_i$, $1\leq i\leq
l$. Then to obtain $U_m$, we first add a new vertex to $G$ labelled $u_m$ and
then join every root $\rho_i$, $1\leq i\leq l$, via an edge with $u_m$ making
$U_m$ a tree with root $u_m$ and leaves contained in $X$.

To obtain the equidistant edge-weighting $\omega_m$ for $U_m$, assume for all
$i\in \{1,\ldots,l\}$ that the height $h_i$ of the tree $(T_i,\omega_i)$ was
computed in one of the previous repetition steps. Note that, by definition,
there must exist leaves $u$ and $v$ with distance $D(u,v)=m$ such that $u_m$
lies on the path from $u$ to $v$ in $U_m$. Then we define $\omega_m$ to be the
map that assigns to every edge $e$ of $U_m$ that is also contained in some
tree $T_i$, $1\leq i\leq l$, its weight under $\omega_i$ and the weight
$m/2-h_i$ if $e$ contains the root $\rho_i$, $1\leq i\leq l$. Since for all
$i\in \{1,\ldots,l\}$ the trees $(T_i,\omega_i)$ are equidistant, it is
straightforward to see that $\omega_m$ is an equidistant edge-weighting for
$U_m$ and that the height of the tree $(U_m,\omega_m) $ is $m/2$.

To complete the repetition step, we replace $X^r$ by $X_m$ and $D$ by $D_m$,
and return to finding a connected component for the new graph $\Gamma^w$ for
$D$. Once the aforementioned termination criterion is satisfied, the found
equidistant tree and its strong lasso is saved and the next run is
started. \textsc{Lasso} stops once all $p$ runs have been completed and returns
the equidistant tree and its strong lasso, as described above.

\subsubsection{Suitable cliques}
\label{sec:cliques}
Central to \textsc{Lasso} is finding a suitable clique in a connected component
of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ where $D$ was constructed in the previous
step of the repetition (or of the input distance if the current step is the
start of the repetition). To be able to define this special type of clique,
assume that $m$ is the minimal edge-weight of a chosen connected component $C$
of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ where $D$ is the distance computed in the
previous step (or again the input distance if we are at the start of the
repetition). Exploiting again the fact that the new element $u_m$ constructed
in the current repetition step can be thought of as the equidistant tree
$(U_m,\omega_m)$ whose leaf set is contained in $X$, we say that a clique in
$C_m$ is {\em suitable} if, over all cliques of $C_m$, the number of taxa of
$X$ it contains is as high as possible. Since the problem of finding such a
clique further requires solving the problem of whether a clique of a pregiven
size $K$ or more exists in a graph, and this is a well known NP-complete
problem \cite{gareyjohnson79}, we use a heuristic for this. More precisely, we
start with a randomly chosen edge $e$ in $C$. Note that $e$ is clearly a
clique. Denoting that clique by $C_e$, and its vertices by $x$ and $y$, we
check for all remaining vertices $z$ of $C$ if they are adjacent with every
vertex of $C_e$ or not. In the former case we update $C_e$ by adding $z$ to
its vertex set and all edges of the form $\{c,z\}$ to its edge set where $c\in
C_e$, and in the latter case we discard $z$.  We continue in this fashion
until we cannot enlarge $C_e$ any further, in which case we stop and save the
found clique. To again mitigate against a poor choice, we repeat this process
$k$-times (ignoring edges that are chosen more than once) where $k$ is a
user-defined parameter that is currently set to ten. The clique that, over all
found cliques, has the largest number of leaves is the clique that we take as
the suitable clique.

\subsubsection{Recomputing the distance $D_m$}
\label{sec:collapsinng-edges}

Continuing with the notation introduced above we define for all vertices $a$
in $C$ but not in $K_m$ the distance $D^*(u_m,a)$ to be the mode over all
distances $D(v,a)$ with $v$ a vertex in $K_m$ (where we break ties randomly).
To ensure that the set of cords returned by \textsc{Lasso} is consistent with the
equidistant tree grown by it, we next remove for all vertices $v$ of $K_m$ all
cords $va$ (and thus also the distances $D(v,a)$) for which
$D(v,a)\not=D^*(u_m,a)$ holds.  Other choices for $D^*$ are conceivable such
as defining $D^*(u_m,a)$ to be the distance one has most confidence in over
all distances $D(v,a)$ or taking the mean over all distances under $D$ of the
form $D(v,a)$ where $v$ is a vertex in $K_m$ and $a$ is a vertex in $C$ but
not in $K_m$, as is the case in average linkage. However it should be noted
that in the latter case the desired consistency property is not guaranteed.

\subsection{An example}
\label{sec:example}

To illustrate the \textsc{Lasso} approach assume that $X=\{a,\ldots, e\}$ is a
taxa set and that $D$ is a partial distance on $X$ given in terms of the
edge-weights of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:pink-const}(i).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/lasso-construction/lasso-ex-3.pdft}
  \caption{For the partial distance $D$ on $X=\{a,\ldots, e\}$ as indicated by
    the edge-weights of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ depicted in (i) we
    depict in (iii) the equidistant tree $(T,\omega)$ returned by \textsc{Lasso}
    and in (iv) the strong lasso found by \textsc{Lasso} for $T$. In (ii) we
    depict updated distance $D_2$ in the first repetition step of \textsc{Lasso}
    in terms of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_{D_2}$.}
  \label{fig:pink-const}
\end{figure}
% 
Then in the first repetition step (i.\,e.\,$q=0$) the minimal edge-weight is
two and the connected component $C$ chosen by \textsc{Lasso} is
$\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ itself as that graph is connected. The subgraph of $C$
with vertex set $\{a,b,c,d\}$, edge set indicated in bold and edge-weights
ignored, is $C_2$. Note that this graph coincides with the connected component
$S_2$ chosen by \textsc{Lasso} as that graph is again connected. The suitable
clique chosen by \textsc{Lasso} is the subgraph with vertex set $\{b,c,d\}$ and
the three edges joining them in the form of a triangle in that figure.  The
equidistant tree $(U_2,\omega_2)$ grown by \textsc{Lasso} is the subtree of the
equidistant tree depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:pink-const}(iii) with leaf set
$\{b,c,d\}$ and edges in bold. Furthermore, the updated distance $D_2$ on
$X_2=\{u_2,e\}$ is represented in terms of the graph $\Gamma^{\omega}_{D_2}$
displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:pink-const}(ii) where the tie was broken by
deleting the cord $de$ and thus removing the distance $D(d,e)$. Putting
$X^r=X_2$ and $D=D_2$ completes the first repetition step. Since
$\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ is again connected and contains more than one vertex a
second repetition step is carried out. Again $C$ is the graph
$\Gamma^{\omega}_D$ itself.  The minimal weight $m$ is six and $C_6$, $S_6$
and $K_6$ all equal $\Gamma^{\omega}_D$. Then $X_6=\{u_6\}$,
$D_6(u_6,u_6)=0$. The equidistant tree $(U_6,\omega_6)$ grown is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:pink-const}(iii). To complete the second repetition step we
now replace $X^r$ by $X_6$ and $D$ by $D_6$. Since the graph
$\Gamma^{\omega}_{D_6}$ is connected \textsc{Lasso} picks $\Gamma^{\omega}_{D_6}$
as the connected component. Since $\Gamma^{\omega}_{D_6}$ contains only the
vertex $u_6$, \textsc{Lasso} terminates. For $Y=\{b,c,d,e\}$, we picture in
Figure~\ref{fig:pink-const}(iv) the strong lasso $\cL_Y$ found by \textsc{Lasso}
for $T$ in terms of the graph $\Gamma(\cL_Y)$. As can be easily checked, this
tree has the most number of leaves of $X$ over all ten runs of \textsc{Lasso} and
so is its found strong lasso.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

The \textsc{Lasso} approach enjoys several attractive theoretical features. These
include that when given a partial distance $D$ on some taxa set $X$, the set
$\cL'$ of cords returned by \textsc{Lasso} (together with the distances for the
cords in that set) uniquely determines the topology as well as the
edge-weighting of the equidistant $X'$-tree $(T,\omega)$ returned by {\sc
  Lasso}, where $X'$ is the vertex set of $\Gamma(\cL')$.  In particular, if
$D$ is such that $\cL_D$ is a topological lasso for $T$ then $X=X'$ that is,
the leaf set of $T$ is the whole of $X$.  Moreover, if $D$ is in fact a
complete distance on $X$ then the distance induced by $(T,\omega)$ on $X$ is
$D$.

Due to, for example, missing data it is in general too much to hope for that
the available distances in a real biological study correspond to a topological
lasso for some equidistant tree. To assess the performance of \textsc{Lasso}
as a tree reconstruction approach with regards to this confounding factor,
while controlling key aspects of the input data, we carried out a simulation
study which is similar in spirit to the one presented in
\cite{criscuolo2008fastnj}.  To gauge the performance of \textsc{Lasso} as a
tree reconstruction approach on a real biological dataset, we applied it to a
yeast dataset \cite{west14ribosomal} recently developed from a whole genome
resequencing study \cite{liti}. We further assessed the potential of
\textsc{Lasso} as a supertree approach by combining two partially overlapping
wheat datasets, developed in distinct studies \cite{gediflux, muge}.  We start
with outlining our missing data simulation scenario.

\subsection{Missing data}
\label{sec:missing-data-disc}

To better understand how the topology of an equidistant tree affects our
ability to reconstruct it from a partial distance, we first generated three
binary $X$-trees, one of which was a balanced tree, a second a caterpillar
tree, and the third we generated using the Yule-Harding model. For this, we
took the size of $X$ to be 128.  For initial unweighted tree simulation, we
implemented the approach described in \cite[Section
2.5]{semple2003phylogenetics}.  Next, we turned each of the resulting trees
into an equidistant $X$-tree. In the balanced tree case we assigned weight one
to all edges. In the caterpillar tree case we assigned the difference in
height between two adjacent vertices to the weight of the joining edge, and in
the Yule-Harding tree case we proceeded as follows. Starting with a
Yule-Harding $X$-tree $T$, we first assign to every vertex $v$ of $T$ the
number $h(v)$ of edges on a longest path from $v$ to a leaf of $T$ below $v$,
where we put $h(v)=0$ in case $v$ is a leaf.  For $e$ an edge of $T$ joining
two vertices $u$ and $v$, we then assign $|h(u)-h(v)|$ as weight to $e$.

For each of these three equidistant $X$-trees, we then generated an incomplete
distance matrix from the induced (complete) distance matrix by randomly
removing a percentage $P_{miss}$ of entries, ensuring that with $\cL$ denoting
the associated set of cords the $\Gamma(\cL)$ graph remained connected. More
precisely, we generated 500 incomplete distance matrices for each of the three
equidistant $X$-tree types using the values $1\%$, $5\%$, $10\%$, $20\%$ and
$30\%$ for $P_{miss}$.  We then used the resulting $3 \times 5 \times 500$
incomplete distance matrices as input to \textsc{Lasso}. Each equidistant tree
found by \textsc{Lasso} was then compared with the respective equidistant
$X$-tree $(T',\omega')$ used to generate the underlying input matrix. More
precisely, for $Y$ denoting the leaf set of a tree $(T,\omega)$ returned by
\textsc{Lasso}, we computed the Robinson-Foulds distance
\cite{robinson1981comparison} $D_{RF}(T,T'|_Y)$ between $T$ and the
restriction $T'|_Y$ of $T'$ to $Y$, that is, we counted the number of clusters
induced by $T'|_Y$ but not by $T$ and vice versa.  For each equidistant
$X$-tree type and percentage $P_{miss}$, we then averaged the obtained 500
distances using the mean. We summarise our results in
Figure~\ref{fig:rob-foulds-shapes} in terms of the {\em normalised
  Robinson-Foulds distance} $D_{RF}(T,T'|_Y)/2(|X|-1)$ between $T$ and
$T'|_Y$, that is, we divided $D_{RF}(T,T'|_Y)$ by the maximal Robinson-Foulds
distance between two $X$-trees, which is $2(|X|-1)$.
Tables~\ref{tab:balanced}, \ref{tab:yule} and \ref{tab:caterpillar} show some
simple statistical measures on the supporting strong lassos.  Mean, min and
max refer to the Robinson-Foulds distance and meanc, minc and maxc refer to
the size of the lasso.

\end{figure}

We observed that, independent of the type of equidistant tree considered, the
Robinson-Foulds distance between $T'|_Y$ and $T$ increases as the number of
distance values decreases, which is as expected. Having said that, out of all
three $X$-tree types equidistant caterpillar trees were reconstructed most
accurately with a mean normalised Robinson-Foulds distance below 0.1 even when
$30\%$ of the distance values were missing. A potential reason for this might
be that to correctly reconstruct a non-leaf vertex $v$ of $T'$ the so-called
child-edge graph associated to $v$ must be a complete graph
\cite{huber13lassoing}.  For $\cL$ a set of cords of $X$, $(R,r)$ an
equidistant $X$-tree and $w$ a non-leaf vertex of $R$, the vertex set of that
graph comprises all edges of $R$ of the form $\{w,u\}$ where $u$ is a child of
$w$, in the usual graph theoretical sense.  Its edge set consists of pairs of
distinct edges $e$ and $e'$ incident with $w$ for which there exist leaves $x$
and $y$ below $w$ such that $e$ lies on the path from $w$ to $x$, $e'$ lies on
the path from $w$ to $y$, and $xy\in \cL$. Since in the case that $T'$ is a
caterpillar tree all but one non-leaf vertex of $T'$ has two children and each
child has at least one leaf below it, the likelihood that the child-edge graph
associated to $v$ is a complete graph is high as an edge in $v$'s child edge
graph tends to be supported by many leaf pairs of $T$ implying that
\textsc{Lasso} correctly reconstructs $v$. On the other hand, a balanced tree
has the most number of vertices both of whose children are leaves. Thus, the
likelihood that the child-edge graph associated to such vertices is not a
complete graph increases as the number of missing distance values grows,
implying that $T$ may be very different from $T'|_Y$. Given that it is
well-known that trees generated under the Yule-Harding model tend to be highly
balanced (see e.\,g.\,\cite[Section 2.5]{semple2003phylogenetics}) it is
unsurprising to see that equidistant Yule-Harding trees and equidistant
balanced trees exhibit a similar behaviour.  Interestingly, equidistant
Yule-Harding trees were reconstructed slightly more accurately than
equidistant balanced trees overall, presumably due to small departures from a
purely balanced state.

- height(c)$.

  \item[4.] If $|X| > 1$ go to step 1, otherwise return $T$ 
%where $X = \{T\}$.
    and its edge-weighting.
  \end{itemize}
\end{algorithm}

Figure~\ref{fig:rob-foulds-shapes} suggests that for low quantities of missing
distances, \textsc{Lasso} is very good at exploiting redundancy in a given
distance matrix to correctly reconstruct the underlying equidistant $X$-tree,
independent of the tree type. To better understand how much this observation
is dependent on the fact that the starting $X$-trees were all binary, we also
investigated the influence of the maximal vertex degree $k$ of such a tree on
\textsc{Lasso}'s performance. To this end, we generated $500$ random
equidistant $X$-trees $(T',\omega')$ with maximum vertex out-degree $k$ as
described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:random-tree}.  The values for $k$ that we used
in this study were $k=2$, $5$, $10$, $20$ and the size of $X$ was always
$100$. We summarise our results in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation-nleaves} in
terms of the average percentage $P_{leaves}$ of the elements in $X$ that are
also present in the leaf set of the equidistant tree $(T,\omega)$ returned by
\textsc{Lasso}.

As expected, $P_{leaves}$ is very high (i.\,e.\,above $80\%$) for all values
of $k$ if the number of missing distances is not too large
(i.\,e.\,$P_{miss}\leq 10\%$) which is encouraging from a supertree
perspective as the out-degree of a vertex can be comparatively high in such
trees.  However with an increasing number of missing distances, equidistant
$X$-trees with a lower maximal degree seem to fare better overall. More
precisely, in the case $k=2$ the equidistant tree returned by \textsc{Lasso}
still contains $80\%$ of the leaves of $T'$ even if $40\%$ of the distance
values are missing. To obtain a similar result for $k=20$ only around $10\%$
of the distance values are allowed to be missing from a distance matrix.  A
potential reason for this discrepancy might be that the more distances are
missing from a distance matrix the more likely it is for the child-edge graph
of a high out-degree vertex not to be a complete graph and thus to not be
correctly reconstructed by \textsc{Lasso}.

\subsection{A yeast dataset}
\label{sec:yeast-dataset}

To test \textsc{Lasso} on a real biological dataset, again as a tree
reconstruction approach in the face of missing data, we applied it to a
distance matrix generated for the analysis of several intra-specific strains
of yeast.  In \cite{west14ribosomal} the authors identified both fully and
partially resolved single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e. SNPs and pSNPS)
within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) tandem arrays of 26 strains of the wild yeast
\textit{Saccharomyces paradoxus}.  A distance matrix was constructed from the
resulting allele frequency dataset using the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards Chord
distance measure \cite{cavalli}.  A phylogenetic tree was estimated using
Neighbor Joining.  The tree was rooted by analysing rDNA variation in S288c,
the type strain of the closely related baker's yeast \textit{Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae}.  We note that the rooted tree built with either \textsc{UPGMA}
or \textsc{Lasso} is very similar to the authors' tree suggesting that the
tree underlying the dataset is indeed equidistant. From the distance $D$ on
the strains induced by the \textsc{Lasso}-tree we then randomly removed $10\%$
of the distance values ensuring that (i) whenever we removed for two strains
$x$ and $y$ the distance $D(x,y)$ we also removed the distance $D(y,x)$, that
(ii) values of the form $D(x,x)$ where $x$ denotes a strain did not count
towards the removed $10\%$, and that (iii) the graph $\Gamma(\cL_D)$ remained
connected. We present the equidistant tree returned by \textsc{Lasso} in
Figure~\ref{fig:yeast-tree-complete}.  Note that this tree contains all 26
input taxa. Furthermore, its topology is highly similar to that produced, on
the full distance matrix, by \cite{west14ribosomal}. Most importantly, the
groupings of the American, Far Eastern and European strains are preserved, as
is the separation of the UK and non-UK derived strains within the European
group. Furthermore, the putative European/Far Eastern hybrid strains $N\_17$
and $N\_45$ are located within the tree at positions consistent with such an
evolutionary history. While some minor changes in topology are seen within the
European and American groups, the relationships within the Far Eastern group
are wholly preserved once 10\% of distances have been removed.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \caption{An equidistant tree returned by \textsc{Lasso} from the yeast

    strains by ``FE'' and the six American strains by ``Am''. The uppermost
    five European strains (CBS5829 to KPN3829), together with N\_17, derive
    from outside the UK, with the remaining ten European strains having been
    isolated within the UK.}
  \label{fig:yeast-tree-complete}
\end{figure}

Since \textsc{Lasso}'s ability to reconstruct an equidistant tree from a
partial distance depends on both which distances are missing and the random
decisions made by the algorithm to break ties, we also constructed a consensus
tree from the equidistant trees returned by \textsc{Lasso} (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:yeast-tree-consense}).  For this, we used an approach similar to
bootstrapping and indicate in terms of numbers assigned to, excepting the
root, the non-leaf vertices how often each cluster induced by such a vertex is
displayed by a equidistant tree returned by \textsc{Lasso}.  More precisely we
generated 100 partial distances with $10\%$ of the distances removed at random
as described above.  We then ran \textsc{Lasso} on each partial distance
resulting in a total of $100$ equidistant trees each supported, on average, by
a strong lasso with 205 cords (out of the possible 293).  The resulting trees
were then used as input to the \textsc{Consense} program
\cite{felsenstein1993phylip} with default settings to build a consensus tree
using the ``majority rule (extended)" option. This tree is again highly
consistent with the full distance matrix tree, differing only from
Figure~\ref{fig:yeast-tree-complete} in the relationship between the three
European strains Q89\_8, Q95\_3 and S36\_7. Noticeably, the support for the
bifurcation of the latter two strains is the only one in
Figure~\ref{fig:yeast-tree-consense} less than 74.

\subsection{A wheat dataset}
\label{sec:wheat-dataset}

Next, we analysed two partially overlapping wheat genetic marker datasets in
order to evaluate the potential of \textsc{Lasso} as a supertree approach. The
first dataset (which we will refer to as dataset $A$) consisted of 57 NBS
(Nucleotide Binding Site) markers scored over 411 accessions, a subset of a
dataset developed within the GEDIFLUX EU Framework V project \cite{gediflux}
to assess genetic diversity over time across four major crops, including
wheat. The second dataset (which we will refer to as dataset $B$) consisted of
71 NBS markers scored over 118 accessions, a subset of a study comparing
genetic diversity within and between winter wheat accessions from Turkey,
Kazakhstan and Europe \cite{muge}, the latter comprising a small group of the
GEDIFLUX wheat accessions. Consequently, the two datasets share a common set
of 26 European winter wheat accessions, comprising 6.3\% and 22.0\% of their
accessions respectively. We will refer to this shared dataset as dataset $C$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/lasso-construction/supp-gedi-groups.pdf}
  \caption{The \textsc{Lasso} tree for wheat dataset $A$.}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/lasso-construction/supp-muge-groups.pdf}
  \caption{The \textsc{Lasso} tree for wheat dataset $B$.}
  \label{fig:lasso-wheat-b}
\end{figure} 

Equidistant trees were estimated for datasets A and B separately, using the
Modified Rogers measure \cite{reif} to calculate a distance matrix, followed
by tree construction with \textsc{Lasso}. For convenience, we denote the two
distance matrices as $d_A$ and $d_B$, where the index indicates the dataset to
which they refer. The resulting equidistant trees were found to be supported
by 77,577 (out of 84,255) and 6,844 (out of 6,903) distances from $d_A$ and
$d_B$ respectively, and are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:lasso-wheat-a} and
\ref{fig:lasso-wheat-b}.  We assessed the individual \textsc{Lasso} trees
according to population group data for the two datasets. In the original
analysis of dataset $B$ \cite{muge}, the model-based clustering method
STRUCTURE \cite{structure} was carried out to estimate the number of founder
populations underlying the dataset and the genetic contribution of each
population to each accession. We coloured branches of the \textsc{Lasso} tree
in Figure~\ref{fig:lasso-wheat-b} such that the colour of each branch
corresponded to the main population group to which the relevant accession
belonged.  For dataset A, we conducted our own population structure analysis,
here using the ADMIXTURE method \cite{admixture} with default parameter
values.  ADMIXTURE uses an identical genetic model to STRUCTURE, but a
different computational approach to optimise population parameters, rendering
it considerably faster to run.  \textsc{Lasso} tree for dataset $A$, coloured
according to these groups, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lasso-wheat-a}. For
both datasets, we see that accessions belonging to the same population group
are largely clustered within the equidistant trees. The large sizes of the two
Lassos (encompassing 92.1\% and 99.1\% of distances within $d_A$ and $d_B$
respectively), together with the consistency of population grouping across the
equidistant trees, strongly suggest the suitability of the \textsc{Lasso}
approach in determining the genetic relationships between accessions within
both of these datasets. Furthermore, we note the previous use of the
\textsc{UPGMA} method to analyse NBS markers for wheat accessions
\cite{mantovani06nbs}.

To obtain a (partial) distance $D$ on the combined dataset of $411+118-26=503$
accessions we proceeded as follows. If $x$ and $y$ are accessions such that
one of them is contained in dataset $A\backslash C$ and the other in $A$ then
we put $D(x,y)=d_A(x,y)$. Similarly, if one of them is contained in dataset
$B\backslash C$ and the other in $B$ then we put $D(x,y)=d_B(x,y)$. For the
remaining case that both accessions are contained in the overlap we took the
mean, that is, we put $D(x,y)=d_A(x,y)+d_B(x,y))/2$ where $x$ and $y$ are the
accessions under consideration.  To mitigate against the fact that for some
accessions in $C$ the distance values $d_A(x,y)$ and $d_B(x,y)$ correlate more
strongly than for others we used the ratio $d_A(x,y)/d_B(x,y)$ to identify
outliers, which we subsequently removed from the analysis. For this, we
employed the distribution of these ratios and defined a distance value to be
an outlier if it is more than one interquartile range above the upper quartile
or one interquartile range below the lower quartile.

\end{figure}

In total, the distance matrix representing $D$ contained 90,814 entries (where
we exclude entries of the form $D(x,x)$ and only count entries of the form
$D(x,y)$ and $D(y,x)$ once) which equates to $28.1\%$ of the $126,253$
potential distance values of a distance matrix on $503$ taxa missing.  We then
used this distance as input for \textsc{Lasso} to obtain a supertree $T$ on
the combined dataset. We depict that supertree in (Fig.~
\ref{fig:wheat-supertree}) and remark in passing that that tree contains all
503 input taxa and that the size of the strong lasso returned by
\textsc{Lasso} supporting $T$ is 89,642. Put differently, $T$ is the unique
equidistant tree that displays correctly 98.7\% of the 90,814 distance values
for $D$.

To better understand the relevance of the obtained supertree $T$ we tested it
with regards to consistency with the original distances on the two
datasets. In addition, we compared its topology against the supertree
generated by the modified \textsc{MinCutSupertree} approach
\cite{page02mincut}.  For the former, we performed Mantel tests between the
distance matrices derived from $d_A$ and $d_B$ and the distances displayed by
$T$.  The tests showed a positive correlation of $0.57$ and $0.47$,
respectively, with $p$-values for both being $0.0009990$. These results
indicate that $T$ displayed relationships between accessions within the two
datasets appropriately, including the overlapping accessions.

For the latter, we employed again the Robinson-Foulds distance. More
precisely, we used the equidistant trees $T_A$ and $T_B$ generated by
\textsc{Lasso} from the datasets $A$ and $B$, respectively, to generate a
supertree $S$ using the modified \textsc{MinCutSupertree} approach. This tree
we then restricted to each of the data sets $A$ and $B$ resulting in the trees
$S|_A$ and $S|_B$, respectively. Next, we restricted the topology $t$ of $T$
to the accessions in $A$ and in $B$, respectively, resulting in the trees
$t|_A$ and $t|_B$ (where the index indicates the data set). For these four
trees we computed the Robinson-Foulds distances between them and found that
$D_{RF}(T_A,S|_A)= 96>79= D_{RF}(T_A,t|_A)$ and that $D_{RF}(T_B,S|_B)=
384>322=D_{RF}(T_B,t|_B)$.  This suggests that the topology of the supertree
returned by \textsc{Lasso} is closer to that of the original trees on the two
datasets than the supertree constructed by the modified
\textsc{MinCutSupertree} approach, thus highlighting {\sc Lassos}'s potential
as a supertree method.

\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we have proposed the novel \textsc{Lasso} approach both for
distance-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction and supertree construction.
Computer code for the \textsc{Lasso} algorithm has been developed and is
freely available from https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/lasso.  \textsc{Lasso}
is similar in spirit to \textsc{UPGMA} but takes as input partial distances
(as opposed to the complete distances required by \textsc{UPGMA}) and aims to
reconstruct a unique (in a well-defined sense), equidistant tree by exploiting
redundancy in a given distance matrix rather than trying to estimate missing
distance values as do approaches such as \cite{criscuolo2008fastnj}. Given
that equidistant trees can be exploited as starting trees within a search of
tree space, for sophisticated phylogenetic methods such as Maximum Likelihood
and Bayesian Inference \cite{burbrink09molecular,bouckaert14beast},
\textsc{Lasso} might provide a quick and promising way to extend these methods
to data sets for which only partial distance information is available. Such
datasets might arise when, for example, confidence in a distance value is low
resulting in an exclusion of that distance (and thus the taxa involved) from
an analysis, or when combining disparate but overlapping datasets in a
supertree context.

We assessed the performance of \textsc{Lasso} by means of artificial and real
biological data.  For the former we considered three different types of binary
equidistant trees and found that, independent of the tree type, \textsc{Lasso}
showed great promise when up to approximately $10\%$ of distance values were
missing.  For higher percentages of missing distance values we found that the
type of equidistant tree started to affect our ability to accurately
reconstruct it. More precisely, the equidistant caterpillar tree was recovered
most accurately under our simulation scenario and the equidistant balanced
tree the least accurately, with the equidistant Yule-Harding tree faring
slightly better than the balanced tree.  We also found that \textsc{Lasso}
showed great promise when the (unknown) equidistant tree underlying the given
partial distance did not possess vertices of too high a degree if a high
proportion of distance values were missing.  Put another way, even with $10\%$
of distance values missing for an underlying equidistant tree with vertices of
maximal out-degree $10$, \textsc{Lasso} was still able to return a tree on
more than $80\%$ of the original taxa.

We also assessed the performance of \textsc{Lasso} on two real biological
datasets. In the first of these studies, a yeast dataset originally developed
and analysed in \cite{west14ribosomal} was successfully reconstructed by
\textsc{Lasso}, even with 10\% of distance values removed at random. In the
second study, \textsc{Lasso} was used to construct a supertree of two
partially overlapping wheat NBS marker datasets \cite{gediflux,
  muge}. Subsequent statistical tests showed both that the \textsc{Lasso}
supertree successfully displayed relationships found with the two original
datasets and that it was more consistent with the two underlying trees than a
supertree constructed using the rival modified \textsc{MinCutSupertree}
approach. Collectively, these studies suggest that \textsc{Lasso} is
potentially a highly useful method for both tree reconstruction and supertree
construction on real datasets.

It is interesting to speculate that the strong performance of \textsc{Lasso}
in a supertree context owes part of its success to its ability to reject
shared distances that are not highly correlated. Indeed, when we repeated our
Mantel tests comparing the equidistant supertree derived from the full
combined dataset (i.e. not rejecting any shared distance values) to the two
separate distance matrices (A and B), the correlations were found to be 0.47
($p = 0.0009990$) for both datasets. Although this performance is almost
identical for dataset $B$, we see that removing certain shared distances leads
to a highly improved result for dataset $A$, which we earlier noted possessed
a lower proportion of distance values within the \textsc{Lasso}.  In future,
an investigation of methods to combine datasets for supertree construction
would be highly valuable, to see whether a further improvement could be
obtained.

Additional future work might include updating the distance in each repetition
step in a different way.  For example, it might be interesting to relax the
consistency requirement slightly by saying that the distances in the computed
tree will be only approximately equal to the distances given in the partial
distance for each outputted cord.  Such a relaxed result could be obtained,
for example, by removing outliers using a standard statistical method and then
computing the mean.  The advantage of this distance would be that \textsc{Lasso}
would remain robust for noisy data as input. Also it might be interesting to
investigate the \textsc{Lasso} approach in a {\em relaxed} molecular clock
framework sensu \cite{drummond06relaxed}.

In summary, we propose the \textsc{Lasso} approach, and accompanying computer
software, to become a new method within the molecular phylogenetics
toolkit. Given its demonstrated potential both in tree reconstruction in the
face of missing data, and in supertree construction, we believe it can play an
important role within a key project of our generation, uncovering the Tree of
Life.
