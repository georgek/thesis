\chapter{Constructing Supertrees from Partial Distances}
\label{cha:constr-ultr-supertr}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:con-summary}

It is well-known that an edge-weighted tree can be constructed from the matrix
if graph-theoretic distances between its leaf nodes.  This chapter considers
the problem of constructing trees from only partial distances.

\section{Lassoing binary ultrametric trees}
\label{sec:lass-ultr-trees}

An algorithm has been developed that constructs a binary ultrametric tree from
a given lasso.  The algorithm is based on the \textsc{BUILD} algorithm.
